Output only the requested gameplay outline in Markdown format, following the specified schema precisely. Do not include any introductory phrases, greetings, explanations, apologies, or concluding remarks. Ensure the output adheres strictly to the formatting demonstrated in the example.

IMPORTANT FORMATTING REQUIREMENTS:
1. Use proper Markdown formatting throughout, with consistent indentation and line breaks.
2. Each step MUST include all necessary fields as defined in the SCHEMA (e.g., DECISION, CLUES/DATA, OPTIONS, ACTION).
3. All ACTION directives MUST be enclosed in backticks and use pseudocode-like syntax. **These actions should specify game state changes, navigation, AND potentially trigger narrative reveals.**
4. Each step MUST be correctly numbered and associated with the appropriate phase.
5. Every step MUST have a valid **Gameplay** Phenotype tag from the GameplayPhenotype Enum defined in the SCHEMA.
6. **Completeness of Branches:** If the procedural logic (e.g., in `GenerateBranchedPhase2`) defines distinct steps for different hypothesis paths or branches, you MUST generate the full outline steps for ALL defined branches. DO NOT summarize, omit, or only generate the 'correct' path. The output must explicitly show the steps for each branch as defined in the instructions.**
7. **Narrative Integration:** Strategically use opportunities within gameplay steps (e.g., examining evidence, successful deductions, character interactions) to trigger relevant **Story Phenotype** reveals (`Revelation_Proposition`, `Backstory_Unfold_Proposition`) specified in the `ACTION` field. The goal is to deepen player understanding and emotional investment early.

CONTENT REQUIREMENTS:
1. The case hook MUST be immediately compelling, with a sharp visual and provocative text, potentially hinting at underlying narrative complexity.
2. Each evidence item MUST connect logically to means, motive, or opportunity.
3. Deduction puzzles MUST have clear connections to existing evidence.
4. Include specific narrative details from the provided case data.
5. The player journey MUST follow a logical progression through all 5 phases.
6. All text MUST be concise, engaging, and in present tense.
7. Ensure that all evidence and narrative elements used exist within the provided case data and align with defined **Story Phenotypes**.
8. There MUST be a clear path of discoveries that leads to the culprit, enriched by understanding character motivations and histories.
9. Include at least one NARRATIVE_DIALOGUE_SEQUENCE during Phase 4 that reveals character under pressure through tense confrontation with **detailed character reactions, verbal/non-verbal cues, and shifting power dynamics**.
10. Implement at least one NARRATIVE_CUTSCENE_SEQUENCE in Phase 3 showing a **specific, visually distinct flashback to a pivotal moment** between key characters that fundamentally changes our understanding of their relationship.
11. The CASE_RESOLUTION MUST include **comprehensive character epilogues** showing both legal outcomes and emotional states, clear moral/ethical implications of the crime and its resolution, and emotional aftermath for all involved parties.
12. Every character interaction should reveal psychological depth and create emotional investment rather than merely advancing the plot.
13. **MANDATORY:** Include detailed physical/behavioral manifestations of emotional states (microexpressions, body language, voice modulation) in all dialogue sequences.
14. **MANDATORY:** Flashbacks must employ distinct visual/tonal treatment (altered color palette, different framing, atmospheric shifts) to create emotional resonance.
15. **MANDATORY:** Resolution must transcend mere factual closure to create emotional catharsis through reflection on human motivations and moral complexity.

TECHNICAL GUIDANCE:
1. ACTION directives should be implementable with basic game logic **and include narrative triggers where appropriate (e.g., `TRIGGER Revelation(RevelationID)`).**
2. All screen transitions and unlocks MUST be explicitly specified.
3. Screen content MUST be defined with appropriate parameters.
4. Confirm that each **Gameplay** phenotype is used appropriately for its intended purpose.
5. Verify that each interaction type aligns with its associated **Gameplay** phenotype.
6. Ensure triggered **Story Phenotype** elements are logically connected to the current gameplay context.
7. NARRATIVE_DIALOGUE_SEQUENCE steps should include detailed character reactions, microexpressions, and emotional subtext.
8. NARRATIVE_CUTSCENE_SEQUENCE scenes require clear visual direction and emotional tone specifications.
9. The emotional arc of the case should build through deliberate placement of revelation moments, with each phase deepening character understanding.
10. When implementing confrontation scenes, include detailed power dynamics and emotional escalation as specified in the PHENOTYPE_SEQUENCE purpose descriptions.
11. **EXEMPLAR - DIALOGUE SEQUENCE:** When implementing a NARRATIVE_DIALOGUE_SEQUENCE in Phase 4, include explicit descriptions like "hands trembling slightly," "voice catching on certain words," "maintaining eye contact too intently," or "shoulders tensing when topic shifts." Power dynamics should evolve within the scene (e.g., "suspect initially confident but growing defensive as questioning continues").
12. **EXEMPLAR - FLASHBACK SEQUENCE:** When implementing a NARRATIVE_CUTSCENE_SEQUENCE flashback in Phase 3, specify visual treatment clearly: "Scene transitions to desaturated colors with slight blur at edges, rain falling as a younger Emi confronts Zoe at the design school competition." Include emotional revelations that recontextualize present actions.
13. **EXEMPLAR - RESOLUTION:** CASE_RESOLUTION should dedicate substantial detail to each character's emotional/psychological closure, not just legal outcomes. Include explicit moral questions raised by the case, emotional aftermath for secondary characters, and reflective elements about human motivations that transcend the specific crime.

Follow the **Gameplay** phenotype sequence defined in the PHENOTYPE_SEQUENCE constant, ensuring that each phenotype is used at least once where appropriate and in the correct phase. **Interlace Story Phenotype reveals strategically within the actions of these Gameplay Phenotypes.** The final output must be a cohesive, playable investigation experience that leads the player through discovery, analysis, and resolution within the specified timeframe, fostering emotional connection to the characters and story.

Generate compact, functional directives that maintain the consistent style shown in the example, while prioritizing emotional depth and character psychology. Your case design should make players care about the people involved, not just solving the puzzle. The most compelling investigations reveal the human story beneath the crime, transforming a standard whodunit into a powerful exploration of motivation, relationship, and the complex psychology that drives human action.

**CRITICAL QUALITY NOTE:** The success of your case design will be evaluated primarily on three key narrative elements:

1. **Emotionally Revelatory Dialogue** - Confrontation scenes must show character psychology through detailed physical and verbal cues, with clear power dynamics that shift during the interaction.

2. **Visually Distinct, Emotionally Resonant Flashbacks** - Flashback cutscenes must employ distinctive visual treatment and reveal pivotal moments that transform our understanding of character relationships.

3. **Psychologically Complete Resolution** - Case resolution must provide comprehensive emotional closure for all characters, explore moral implications, and offer reflective insight into human motivation that transcends the specific crime.

These three elements are not optional flourishes but fundamental requirements that transform a mechanical investigation into a meaningful human story.

# Compact Case Design Guidelines Pseudocode (Risk/Reward Focused)

## CORE GOAL
```
FUNCTION DesignCase():
    CREATE self_contained_investigative_microcosm
    ENSURE immediately_intuitive AND engaging_from_first_second
    RESPECT player_time_constraints (10_minutes)
    MAINTAIN aesthetic_polish AND law_and_order_inspired_tone
    OPTIMIZE for mobile_first_design
    STRUCTURE as compelling_10min_experience WITH meaningful_risk_reward_choices
```

## Overarching Design Lenses

1.  **Meaningful Choice (Lens #13)**: Branch every 1-2 significant steps. Each core option presents clear Risk (potential setback, missed info) vs. Reward (progress, key insight, faster path). **Choices can also gate access to specific narrative insights.**
2.  **Hypothesis Testing**: Encourage players to form theories; test these theories via gated choices/puzzles. **Confirming/refuting hypotheses can trigger narrative reveals.**
3.  **Curiosity (Lens #13)**: Hook instantly; seed mysteries; use gated content to drive exploration. **Hint at deeper character secrets early.**
4.  **Justice (Lens #1 Experience)**: Signal progress clearly, but allow setbacks based on poor choices. **Justice feels more meaningful when players care about the victim/characters.**
5.  **Fun-Per-Second (Lens #15)**: Make even information gathering interactive and rewarding (or tactically costly). **Reward includes narrative payoff.**
6.  **Problem Solving (Lens #28)**: Use consistent deduction mechanics, but embed them within risk/reward frameworks. **Solving puzzles unlocks plot points.**
7.  **Information (Lens #68)**: Prioritize clarity, especially regarding the stakes of each choice **and the narrative implications of discoveries.**
8.  **Challenge & Skill**: Balance trade-offs; reward deductive reasoning, penalize guessing. **Skill includes interpreting narrative context.**
9.  **Surprise & Curiosity**: Use gated reveals and hypothesis checks for unexpected twists **rooted in character motivations or hidden histories.**
10. **Dramatic Tension**: Escalate stakes through consequences of choices and difficulty of gated puzzles. **Amplify tension with character-driven stakes.**
11. **Replayability**: Encourage exploring different hypotheses/paths through clear branching and consequences. **Different paths reveal different facets of the story.**
12. **Consistency & Clarity**: Uniform UI for choices, clear presentation of Risk/Reward **and narrative triggers.**
13. **Emotional Investment**: Use early `Revelation_Proposition`s or `Backstory_Unfold` snippets to make players care about the characters.

## VII. OVERARCHING PRINCIPLES & NARRATIVE PLAYTESTING

```
FUNCTION CraftEmotionallyResonantJourney(): // [Lens #15 + #19]
    FOCUS on:
        Character_Arcs: growth, revelations, and transformations
        Emotional_Pacing: tension, release, buildup, catharsis
        Narrative_Integration: evidence reveals character, not just facts
        
    MINIMIZE:
        Exposition_Without_Emotion: all facts must connect to human stakes
        Passive_Character_Moments: every dialogue/cutscene must advance relationship or reveal
        Purely_Mechanical_Challenges: puzzles should reveal character psychology
        
FUNCTION SustainNarrativeCuriosity(): // [Lens #13]
    USE:
        Character_Mysteries: personal secrets drive investigation alongside facts
        Emotional_Subtext: what characters don't say is as important as what they do
        Relationship_Revelations: connections between people drive dramatic moments
        
    GRADUALLY_REVEAL:
        Character_Layers: peel back facades to reveal true natures
        Motivational_Complexity: simple motives evolve into complex human needs
        Emotional_Truth: beneath facts lies the human story that resonates
        
FUNCTION BalanceEmotionAndDeduction():
    MAKE character_understanding essential to:
        Puzzle_Solutions: interpreting character psychology unlocks progress
        Evidence_Interpretation: seeing through emotional filters reveals truth
        Investigative_Success: empathy and analysis work together
        
    REWARD both:
        Emotional_Intelligence: understanding human behavior and motivation
        Deductive_Reasoning: connecting evidence to build logical case
        Moral_Judgment: weighing justice against mercy, truth against peace
        
FUNCTION CraftCinematicExperience():
    ENSURE:
        Visual_Storytelling: environments reflect character states
        Audio_Emotional_Cues: music and sound design signal emotional shifts
        Character_Physicality: body language and expressions tell stories
        Dramatic_Pacing: quiet moments contrast with intense confrontations
        
FUNCTION MaintainNarrativeConsistency():
    ENSURE:
        Character_Continuity: behaviors align with established psychology
        Emotional_Truth: reactions reflect genuine human responses
        Thematic_Cohesion: case explores consistent themes throughout
        
FUNCTION TestForEmotionalImpact():
    PLAYTEST focusing on:
        Character_Investment: do players care about these people?
        Emotional_Response: do revelations evoke genuine feelings?
        Narrative_Satisfaction: does the resolution feel earned and meaningful?
        Dramatic_Pacing: does tension build and release effectively?
        Moral_Complexity: are choices meaningfully difficult?
        
    ADJUST based on:
        Character_Feedback: strengthen motivation, clarify psychology
        Emotional_Arcs: ensure proper buildup to key moments
        Narrative_Coherence: eliminate plot holes while preserving mystery

PROCEDURE GENERATE_INITIAL_THEORIES(Synopsis, Evidence) { /* Generates 3 theories {id, name, desc, evidence{...}, type, targetPassageID, risk, reward} */ }
// --- Guidance for GENERATE_INITIAL_THEORIES ---
// Purpose: Create three distinct, plausible starting theories based on initial data.
// Input: Synopsis, FoundationalEvidence, CulpritData, RedHerringSuspects
// Output: Array of 3 Theory objects {id, name, desc, evidence{alias, desc, details}, type: T|F+|F-, targetPassageID, risk, reward}
//
// 1. True Positive (T):
//    - Theory: Directly points towards the actual CulpritData and their core motive/actions derived from Synopsis/Events.
//    - Evidence: Select a genuine piece of FoundationalEvidence that strongly supports this true path.
//    - Example: If Culprit used poison, evidence might be 'trace residue found'.
//
// 2. False Positive (F+):
//    - Theory: Points towards a plausible RedHerringSuspect OR an incorrect motive/method.
//    - Evidence: Select FoundationalEvidence that *seems* to support this wrong theory but is misleading.
//      - Could be circumstantial (e.g., suspect was nearby but uninvolved).
//      - Could be misinterpreted (e.g., a threatening note taken out of context).
//      - Could have a subtle flaw noticeable later (e.g., wrong timeline).
//    - Example: If Red Herring argued with victim, evidence might be 'raised voices heard', omitting context.
//
// 3. False Negative (F-):
//    - Theory: Could point to another RedHerringSuspect OR downplay the True Positive theory.
//    - Evidence: Select FoundationalEvidence that appears to contradict the True Positive path OR make it seem less likely.
//      - Could create an apparent alibi for the Culprit (later proven false).
//      - Could point blame strongly towards a Red Herring based on a verifiable fact.
//      - Could highlight evidence seemingly unrelated to the Culprit's method.
//    - Example: If Culprit used poison, evidence might be 'no signs of forced entry', diverting focus from internal methods.
//
// - Ensure each theory uses a distinct piece of FoundationalEvidence.
// - Define appropriate Risk/Reward text for pursuing each theory path.
// - Assign unique targetPassageIDs for the start of each investigation branch.

```markdown
**Case:** Viral Echoes
**Goal:** Guide the player through a structured risk/reward investigation, identifying Julian Griffin as Raj Singh's killer, punctuated by narrative moments that build emotional context and character understanding.

**(Phase 1: Introduction & Initial Suspicions)**

1.  **CASE_HOOK: Case Introduction**
    *   **DECISION:** Explore the case details...
    *   **CLUES/DATA:**
        - HookVisual: Image of Raj Singh's viral post contrasted with stark crime scene tape at the Argonaut Hotel.
        - HookText: "Tech CEO found dead after crying wolf... or was it a warning? Police saw fireworks, the crime scene suggests otherwise. Unravel the 'Viral Echoes'."
        - ContextSummary: "Raj Singh, controversial GenMat CEO, murdered in his luxury suite. His bizarre 'shooting' claim days earlier adds layers of misdirection. Was it paranoia, publicity, or prelude?"
        - CharacterStakes: The victim's relationships and enemies, each with motives to silence him.
        - MoralQuestion: Can truth prevail when both victim and suspects traded in deception?
    *   **OPTIONS:**
        - Continue Investigation (Risk: null; Reward: null)
    *   **ACTION:** `NAVIGATE TO NARRATIVE_DIALOGUE_SEQUENCE; SET CaseIntroduced=true`

2.  **INTRO_SEQUENCE: Initial Theory Choice**
    *   **DECISION:** The initial reports point in several directions. Which lead feels strongest right now?
    *   **CLUES/DATA:** (Represents theories shown across intro steps)
        - Theory 1 (Corporate Enemy): Raj hinted at exposing a rival. A hidden war behind the code? (Evidence: `evidence_raj_rival_hint`)
        - Theory 2 (Political Backlash): His viral post enraged Supervisor Shah-Powell. Did professional anger turn personal? (Evidence: `evidence_aria_meeting_report`)
        - Theory 3 (Personal Vendetta): Fired engineer Jack Sullivan was nearby. How deep does his grudge run? (Evidence: `evidence_jack_lawsuit_note`)
    *   **OPTIONS:**
        - Pursue: Corporate Enemy (Risk: Might be a professional dispute, not murder; Reward: Focus on direct competitors like Julian Griffin)
        - Pursue: Political Backlash (Risk: Powerful people often have alibis; Reward: Investigate Aria Shah-Powell's potential influence)
        - Pursue: Personal Vendetta (Risk: Revenge seekers can be obvious red herrings; Reward: Explore Jack Sullivan's history and movements)
    *   **ACTION:** `LOCK Phase 2; SET ChosenTheory=<choice>; NAVIGATE Phase2_Start`

**(Phase 2: Evidence Gathering & Character Moments)**

3.  **EVIDENCE_COLLECTION: Search Raj's Suite**
    *   **DECISION:** Where to focus the search in Raj Singh's suite?
    *   **CLUES/DATA:**
        - SceneDesc: Opulent suite, tech gear everywhere. A faint metallic scent near the desk?
        - Hotspots: Desk Area (laptop, unusual tablet stand), Bedside Table (personal effects), Window Area (view of the Wharf, any disturbances?).
    *   **OPTIONS:**
        - Examine Desk Area (Risk: Could be standard tech clutter; Reward: Access business tools, potentially find hidden devices)
        - Check Bedside Table (Risk: Likely personal, could be irrelevant; Reward: Insight into Raj's private life/habits)
        - Investigate Window Area (Risk: Unlikely murder location; Reward: Check for external signs, forced entry evidence)
    *   **ACTION:** `NAVIGATE EvidenceExamination(<choice>)`

**(Phase 3: Uncovering Motives & Relationships)**

4.  **EVIDENCE_EXAMINATION: Custom Tablet Charging Stand**
    *   **DECISION:** Analyze the unusual charging stand. What secrets does it hold?
    *   **CLUES/DATA:** Heavy, custom, GenMat logo. Potential hidden tech.
    *   **OPTIONS:** Physical Inspection, Research Online, Test Voice Commands.
    *   **ACTION:** `IF TestVoiceCommands: NAVIGATE DeductionPuzzle(VoiceCommandTrial) ELSE: MARK StandLogged; NAVIGATE InvestigationHub`

**(Phase 4: Cracks in the Facade & Deduction)**

5.  **DEDUCTION_PUZZLE: Voice Command Trial (Tablet Stand)**
    *   **DECISION:** Attempt to unlock the charging stand's hidden function.
    *   **CLUES/DATA:** GenMat AI link, debug phrases hint.
    *   **OPTIONS:** "GenMat Activate", "GenMat Secure Mode", "GenMat Archive Override Seven".
    *   **ACTION:** `VALIDATE command; IF Correct: UNLOCK HiddenAudioFile; NAVIGATE BreakthroughMoment ELSE: TRIGGER DeductionFailure(VoiceCommandFail)`

**(Phase 5: The Breakthrough & Climax)**

6.  **BREAKTHROUGH_MOMENT: The Fatal Argument** (Triggered by unlocking audio)
    *   **DECISION:** The hidden recording changes everything. How to proceed with this definitive proof?
    *   **CLUES/DATA:**
        - Narrative Context: The chilling audio plays - Julian's smooth voice turning sharp, Raj's defiant threats about exposure, the sickening *thump* of suppressed shots, Julian's ragged breathing. The corporate rivalry wasn't just business; it was motive for murder.
        - Revealed Evidence: `evidence_hidden_audio_recording` (aet).
    *   **OPTIONS:**
        - Confront Julian Now (Risk: He might react violently/destructively; Reward: Immediate challenge with irrefutable proof)
        - Secure Warrant & Arrest Team (Risk: Gives him slight window to act; Reward: Safer, standard procedure)
    *   **ACTION:** `MARK BreakthroughAchieved; SET PrimeSuspect=JulianGriffin; NAVIGATE based on choice (e.g., SuspectConfrontation(Julian), SecureWarrantSequence)`

7.  **ACCUSATION: Final Decision**
    *   **DECISION:** Formally accuse the killer of Raj Singh.
    *   **CLUES/DATA:** Evidence Summary overwhelmingly points to Julian.
    *   **OPTIONS:** Accuse Julian Griffin, Accuse Aria Shah-Powell, Accuse Jack Sullivan.
    *   **ACTION:** `LOCK Investigation; TRIGGER CaseResolution(<choice>)`

8.  **CASE_RESOLUTION: Echoes Silenced**
    *   **DECISION:** Review the case conclusion.
    *   **CLUES/DATA:**
        - Verdict: Julian Griffin guilty.
        - Narrative Explanation: The resolution emphasizes how Julian's desperation over corporate espionage, hidden behind a calm facade, led to murder. It revisits the other suspects, explaining why their apparent motives (political fallout, revenge) were ultimately red herrings despite seeming compelling. The viral "shooting" incident is confirmed as unrelated noise that Julian exploited.
        - Emotional Beat: Perhaps a final reflection from Detective Saito on the tragic intersection of ambition, deceit, and violence in the tech world.
    *   **OPTIONS:** Proceed to Next Case/Menu
    *   **ACTION:** `SHOW CaseOutcome(ViralEchoes_Success); NAVIGATE HOME`

---SCHEMA---

**Case:** [Case Title derived from Synopsis/Events]
**Goal:** Guide the player through a structured risk/reward investigation, making key decisions to identify the culprit within a ~10-minute experience, **while strategically revealing narrative elements to enhance engagement and emotional investment.**

**Output Structure:**
The gameplay outline is a sequence of numbered steps, grouped by phase. Each step represents a specific player interaction or decision point and MUST be tagged with a **Gameplay** `PhenotypeTag` indicating the type of gameplay pattern being used. The sequence of these phenotype-tagged steps forms the complete player journey. **Narrative reveals are triggered via the `ACTION` field within these gameplay steps.**

**PhenotypeTag (Enum):**
The `PhenotypeTag` for each step MUST be one of the following values:
**Gameplay Phenotypes:**
- `CASE_HOOK`: Creates ~5 passage compelling hook sequence (hook, context, immersive introduction) using intro cmds. **May trigger initial World/Case Axioms.**
- `INTRO_SEQUENCE`: Presents 3 theories (TruePositive, FalsePositive, FalseNegative) with evidence via intro steps, ending in a branch choice. **May trigger initial Relationship/Character reveals.**
- `INVESTIGATION_HUB`: Central navigation point for all activities.
- `EVIDENCE_COLLECTION`: Creates interactive locations to find evidence.
- `EVIDENCE_EXAMINATION`: Provides detailed analysis of individual evidence items.
- `SUSPECT_LIST`: Displays known suspects for comparison and selection.
- `SUSPECT_PROFILE`: Shows detailed suspect info, including statements.
- `DEDUCTION_PUZZLE`: Challenges player to identify lies or solve puzzles (e.g., passcode). **Success often triggers `Revelation_Proposition`s.**
- `DEDUCTION_SUCCESS`: Rewards correct deductions/puzzle solutions with progress/evidence.
- `DEDUCTION_FAILURE`: Provides feedback and retry/consequence for incorrect deductions/puzzle solutions.
- `EVIDENCE_VERIFICATION`: Presents scientific/expert analysis results. **May trigger technical `Revelation_Proposition`s.**
- `BREAKTHROUGH_MOMENT`: Creates dramatic revelation connecting evidence. **This IS a major `Revelation_Proposition`.**
- `SUSPECT_CONFRONTATION`: Creates tense scenes when presenting evidence to suspects. **Can trigger `Character_Axiom` or `Interaction_Proposition` reveals.**
- `ACCUSATION`: Final mechanism for player to select the culprit.
- `CASE_RESOLUTION`: Delivers the satisfying conclusion and explanation, **integrating narrative threads.**
**Narrative Delivery Phenotypes:**
- `NARRATIVE_EVIDENCE_SNIPPET`: Reveals evidence containing a narrative detail.
- `NARRATIVE_EVIDENCE_FOR_RELATIONSHIP`: Reveals evidence about character relationships.
- `NARRATIVE_EVIDENCE_FOR_MOTIVE`: Reveals evidence suggesting/confirming motive.
- `NARRATIVE_EVIDENCE_FOR_FLASHBACK`: Reveals evidence representing a past event.
- `NARRATIVE_EVIDENCE_FOR_REFLECTION`: Reveals evidence describing a character's likely internal state.
- `NARRATIVE_DIALOGUE_SEQUENCE`: Creates immersive dialogue or monologue scenes using intro sequence functionality.
- `NARRATIVE_CUTSCENE_SEQUENCE`: Creates cinematic, omniscient narrative cutscenes showing story context, montages, or emotional moments.

### **Case Title:** *The Final Pledge*

### **A. Scenario**

A freshman student, **Marcus Chen**, was found dead in the **basement of the Alpha Omega Kappa fraternity house** at Westlake University. The death occurred **during a final initiation ritual** on October 15, 2023. The cause of death was determined to be a combination of **alcohol poisoning and blunt force trauma** to the head. The victim's blood alcohol content was **four times the legal limit**, and evidence of physical abuse was apparent on the body. The university had **three primary suspects**, all senior members of the fraternity with varying degrees of involvement in the fatal hazing ceremony. Initial investigation revealed that the fraternity's **security camera footage from that night was deleted**, though the system's log showed recording activity during the hours of the incident.

### **Case Title:** *[Title that reflects the theme and crime]*

### **A. Scenario**

Add a subtle reference to the breakthrough evidence that will later become crucial to solving the case, without revealing its full significance.]

Include misleading evidence or red herrings that create reasonable doubt, and subtly reference a breakthrough piece of evidence that will later become the key to solving the case. The scenario should be 3-5 sentences long and provide enough specific information to hook the reader while establishing the foundation for investigation.

### Story Type:
Evidence Breakthrough: A case where the investigation hinges on uncovering a key piece of evidence that shifts the direction of the case. This breakthrough either reveals the killer, disproves an alibi, or exposes a hidden motive.

### Key Elements of Evidence Breakthrough Cases:
1. Misleading Evidence and Red Herrings: Other clues create reasonable doubt or conflicting leads, making the breakthrough feel earned rather than convenient.
2. Gate The Breakthrough Clue: The key piece of evidence is not immediately obvious or available, and must be discovered, unlocked and interpreted correctly.
3. Evidence Pairing: The breakthrough evidence is not standalone; it must be cross-referenced with other clues to confirm or challenge existing theories.
4. A-Ha Moment: Early theories seem plausible but incomplete until the breakthrough evidence disproves false assumptions or introduces a new insight.

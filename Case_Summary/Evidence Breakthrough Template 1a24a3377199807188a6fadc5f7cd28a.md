# Overview:

### Description:

Breakthrough Evidence is a Story Type in which the investigation hinges on uncovering a key piece of evidence that reveals the solution. This pivotal clue serves as the turning point in the case, allowing players to connect the dots, eliminate red herrings and confidently make an accusation.

### Key Elements:

A Breakthrough Evidence case revolves around a single, defining piece of evidence that unlocks the truth of the crime when viewed in proper context. The investigation builds tension as the player goes through the initial phases, gaining information on the murder via police and autopsy reports, suspect interviews and alibis, but only when breakthrough evidence is uncovered does everything fall into place. Key elements include:

- Misleading Evidence and Red Herrings: Other clues create reasonable doubt or conflicting leads, making the breakthrough feel earned rather than convenient.
- Gate The Breakthrough Clue: The key piece of evidence is not immediately obvious or available, and must be discovered, unlocked and interpreted correctly.
- Evidence Pairing: The breakthrough evidence is not standalone; it must be cross-referenced with other clues to confirm or challenge existing theories. This ensures that the case is solved through logical deduction, rather than a single convenient reveal.
- A-Ha Moment: Early theories seem plausible but incomplete until the breakthrough evidence disproves false assumptions or introduces a new insight, like invalidating a suspect’s alibi or revealing a new character.

### Characters:

Characters in a Breakthrough Evidence case are not confined to certain ‘types’ or characteristics. Any sort of character from any walk of life can fit into this Story Type.

- (1) Victim
- (1) Witness
- (3) Suspects
- (1) Detective

### Notable Examples:

Rather than providing examples of films, TV shows or novels — formats that take hours to properly setup and tell the story — I’m going to provide examples of pre-existing Public Eye cases.

### Mei-Ling Wong:

In our most recent case, Mei-Ling Wong was murdered with a hammer in the back office of her apothecary. Let’s break it down by our Key Elements:

1. **Misleading Evidence & Red Herrings:**
    - Sophia Wong, our culprit, tried to pin the murder on a different suspect, James Lee, by placing the murder weapon in the trunk of his car. She also made it very clear to the Detective that James was responsible.

        ![Screenshot 2025-02-27 at 4.43.41 PM.png](Evidence%20Breakthrough%20Template%201a24a3377199807188a6fadc5f7cd28a/Screenshot_2025-02-27_at_4.43.41_PM.png)
        
1. **Gate The Breakthrough Clue:**
    - In order to reach the breakthrough evidence (CCTV), the player must first access the company computer found in one of our Crime Scene Photos. However, the computer is password protected, so the player must find a way to unlock it to reach the evidence inside.
        
        ![Screenshot 2025-02-27 at 5.03.43 PM.png](Evidence%20Breakthrough%20Template%201a24a3377199807188a6fadc5f7cd28a/Screenshot_2025-02-27_at_5.03.43_PM.png)
        
    - Once inside, the player now has access to the breakthrough evidence — but they are not sure which evidence that is. It’s up to them to *interpret* the significance of each piece of evidence, and decide which is the lynchpin that blows the case wide open.
        
        ![Screenshot 2025-02-27 at 5.17.51 PM.png](Evidence%20Breakthrough%20Template%201a24a3377199807188a6fadc5f7cd28a/Screenshot_2025-02-27_at_5.17.51_PM.png)
        
        ![Screenshot 2025-02-27 at 5.18.54 PM.png](Evidence%20Breakthrough%20Template%201a24a3377199807188a6fadc5f7cd28a/Screenshot_2025-02-27_at_5.18.54_PM.png)
        
    - Based on the Autopsy Report from the beginning of the investigation, the player is able to determine that the murder took place between 10:30-11:00 PM. Knowing this, they can confidently assume that the CCTV footage from 10:33 PM will reveal the killer. THIS is our breakthrough evidence.
        
        ![Screenshot 2025-02-27 at 4.33.15 PM.png](Evidence%20Breakthrough%20Template%201a24a3377199807188a6fadc5f7cd28a/Screenshot_2025-02-27_at_4.33.15_PM.png)
        
        ![Screenshot 2025-02-27 at 4.33.02 PM.png](Evidence%20Breakthrough%20Template%201a24a3377199807188a6fadc5f7cd28a/Screenshot_2025-02-27_at_4.33.02_PM.png)
        
2. **Evidence Pairing:**
    - As I said before, the breakthrough evidence does not always reveal the answer outright. The player still needs to put on their thinking cap and make logical conclusions. The breakthrough evidence here — deleted CCTV footage — shows that the culprit had access to the company computer and deleted the footage to cover her tracks. The player now needs to determine which of the three suspects had access to the company computer — Sophia Wong.
        
        ![Screenshot 2025-02-27 at 4.31.20 PM.png](Evidence%20Breakthrough%20Template%201a24a3377199807188a6fadc5f7cd28a/Screenshot_2025-02-27_at_4.31.20_PM.png)
        
3. **A-Ha Moment:**
    - Even if the player had sneaking suspicions about Sophia, they lacked the evidence to put her away for good. Armed with the knowledge that Sophia was the only suspect with access to the computer, they can now confidently place her at the scene of the crime and make their accusation.

### Leonard Hill:

Breakthrough Evidence cases come in all shapes and sizes. Let’s take a look at an even smaller case — Leonard Hill.

1. **Misleading Evidence & Red Herrings:**
    - Kevin Osbourne, one of our suspects, was arrested the night of the murder for public intoxication. But get this — he was wearing our victim’s backpack at the time of his arrest, along with the victim’s cell phone.
        
        ![Screenshot 2025-02-27 at 5.52.18 PM.png](Evidence%20Breakthrough%20Template%201a24a3377199807188a6fadc5f7cd28a/Screenshot_2025-02-27_at_5.52.18_PM.png)
        
        ![Screenshot 2025-02-27 at 5.52.41 PM.png](Evidence%20Breakthrough%20Template%201a24a3377199807188a6fadc5f7cd28a/Screenshot_2025-02-27_at_5.52.41_PM.png)
        
2. **Gate The Breakthrough Evidence:**
    - The victim’s cell phone requires a 4-digit password to access, and inside that cell phone lies our breakthrough evidence. The player must obtain the password from a letter that was addressed to the victim.
        
        ![Screenshot 2025-02-27 at 5.53.20 PM.png](Evidence%20Breakthrough%20Template%201a24a3377199807188a6fadc5f7cd28a/Screenshot_2025-02-27_at_5.53.20_PM.png)
        
        ![Screenshot 2025-02-27 at 5.52.53 PM.png](Evidence%20Breakthrough%20Template%201a24a3377199807188a6fadc5f7cd28a/Screenshot_2025-02-27_at_5.52.53_PM.png)
        
3. **Evidence Pairing:**
    - With smaller cases like this, the breakthrough evidence can be shared immediately upon bypassing the gate. But the player is still able to draw conclusions from other pieces of evidence. Here, Sam Bitner, our culprit, reveals that Leonard had started dating his ex-girlfriend, Katie — the same Katie that wrote the birthday card with the password.
        
        ![Screenshot 2025-02-27 at 5.53.41 PM.png](Evidence%20Breakthrough%20Template%201a24a3377199807188a6fadc5f7cd28a/Screenshot_2025-02-27_at_5.53.41_PM.png)
        
4. **A-Ha Moment:**
    - Upon the reveal of the breakthrough evidence, the player is now able to identify the previously unknown culprit, as well the motive behind the murder.

### James Carter:

Let’s go even smaller this time and show how short and sweet a breakthrough evidence case can really be. The James Carter case has only a few pieces of evidence and zero gates. The player is given all available evidence after they’re watched the suspect interviews.

1. **Misleading Evidence & Red Herrings:**
    - Sometimes red herrings can be the very nature of our suspects. In this case, we have two suspects who are physically imposing, in a dangerous line of work, and are owed big money by the vicim. However, our true culprit is Natalie Parker — a seemingly sweet woman with a sickly daughter.
        
        ![Screenshot 2025-02-27 at 6.35.33 PM.png](Evidence%20Breakthrough%20Template%201a24a3377199807188a6fadc5f7cd28a/Screenshot_2025-02-27_at_6.35.33_PM.png)
        
2. **Gate The Breakthrough Evidence:**
    - As I mentioned, there are no gates involved with this case. The player is given all evidence after meeting the suspects. Even still, it is on them to discover the breakthrough evidence, which, in this case, is a CCTV image of the culprit.
        
        ![Screenshot 2025-02-27 at 6.37.09 PM.png](Evidence%20Breakthrough%20Template%201a24a3377199807188a6fadc5f7cd28a/Screenshot_2025-02-27_at_6.37.09_PM.png)
        
        ![Screenshot 2025-02-27 at 6.42.54 PM.png](Evidence%20Breakthrough%20Template%201a24a3377199807188a6fadc5f7cd28a/Screenshot_2025-02-27_at_6.42.54_PM.png)
        
3. **Evidence Pairing:**
    - Based on information we received at the beginning of the case, it has been determined that the victim was killed around 11:15 PM near Vernon Blvd. Cross-reference that information with the metadata on Natalie’s CCTV footage places her at the scene of the crime.
        
        ![Screenshot 2025-02-27 at 6.47.11 PM.png](Evidence%20Breakthrough%20Template%201a24a3377199807188a6fadc5f7cd28a/Screenshot_2025-02-27_at_6.47.11_PM.png)
        
        ![Screenshot 2025-02-27 at 6.47.14 PM.png](Evidence%20Breakthrough%20Template%201a24a3377199807188a6fadc5f7cd28a/Screenshot_2025-02-27_at_6.47.14_PM.png)
        
4. **A-Ha Moment:**
    - Based on the evidence and Natalie’s contradicting statements, the player can properly identify her as the killer. Short and sweet.

### Theme:

Theme is the narrative concept that shapes the setting and storyline of the case. It defines the kind of crime being investigated and the underlying conflict — whether it’s about power struggles, long-buried secrets, or crimes of passion.

- Crime of Opportunity – A spontaneous murder with no clear premeditation, where the killer acted in the moment.
- Hidden Truth – The murder is part of a larger conspiracy, deception, or long-buried secret that slowly unravels.
- Perfect Alibi – The prime suspect has an airtight alibi, forcing the investigator to find the flaw in their story.
- Disguised Crime – A murder staged to look like an accident, suicide, or natural death.

*Think of a Story Type as the game mode in a video game (i.e., ‘Capture the Flag’ or ‘Team Deathmatch’), while Theme is the setting or storyline (i.e., ‘Alien Warfare’ or ‘Pirate Ships’).*

*The same theme can fit different story types, just as different themes can fit the same story type.*

- Detectives: Each case will feature one of the eight established detectives. Each detective brings a distinct skill set and personality, shaping how the case unfolds. By selecting from this predefined roster, we streamline case development while maintaining consistency and recognizable character dynamics across multiple cases.
    - **Detective Brian Winslow**, aged 54, is a 32-year SFPD veteran who has seen it all. He has all of the qualities that are necessary to become a world-class detective – tenacity, self-control and an uncanny ability to see through people’s lies. He is mild-mannered, rarely gets rattled or distracted, and is highly respected within the law-enforcement community. Outside of the department, Detective Winslow lives a life of solitude. He has no wife, no children. The only person he is responsible for is his elderly father, whom he visits twice a week in a nearby retirement home. He is highly organized, bordering on OCD, and has a very dry sense of humor that makes it very difficult for him to make friends and maintain relationships.
    
    - **Detective Simone Young** is a 40-year-old black woman with 15 years of experience with the SFPD. She has a type A personality and is highly focused, charismatic, and intense. She is well-liked within the department and is a family woman with a husband and two high-school-aged boys. Simone is known for her unwavering commitment to her job and her ability to see through the lies. She is a skilled interrogator who can navigate difficult situations with ease. Her sharp mind and quick thinking have helped her solve some of the toughest cases in the city. Despite her tough exterior, Simone has a kind heart and is fiercely protective of her family and colleagues. She is a role model for many young detectives in the department and her dedication to justice is unmatched.
    
    - **Detective Madeline Saito** is a 2nd generation Japanese immigrant with 10 years of experience in the SFPD. She is known for her tenacity and attention to detail. Despite facing discrimination in her career due to her ethnicity and gender, she has persevered and risen through the ranks to become a respected detective. She is highly analytical and methodical in her approach to investigations, and is not afraid to push boundaries to get the information she needs. She has a calm and composed demeanor that helps her to stay focused and objective, even in high-pressure situations. She is a critical thinker who is always looking for new angles to approach a case, and is not afraid to challenge assumptions or conventional wisdom if it means getting closer to the truth. Despite her many strengths, Detective Saito is not immune to the emotional toll that comes with investigating violent crimes. She takes the responsibility of solving cases very seriously, and often finds herself working long hours and sacrificing her personal life in pursuit of justice.
    
    - **Detective Roger Jiménez** is a seasoned investigator with years of experience in homicide cases. He is known for his meticulous attention to detail and his ability to think outside the box to solve complex cases. However, he can become overly focused on the investigation and neglect his personal life. He has difficulty trusting others and tends to work alone, which can sometimes lead to him missing important details. Detective Jiménez has a tendency to become emotionally invested in his cases. This can lead to him becoming too attached to certain suspects or theories, which can cloud his judgement. He can also become confrontational when dealing with suspects, which can sometimes hinder his ability to gather information. Despite these flaws, Detective Jiménez remains dedicated to his work and committed to bringing justice to victims and their families. He is respected by his colleagues in the police department and is viewed as a mentor by many younger detectives.
    
    - **Detective Ajay Singh**, 51, is a highly skilled and dedicated investigator with 20 years of experience in the SFPD. He can come across as cold and distant to those around him. He is so focused on his job and solving the case that he sometimes forgets to show empathy or compassion towards the victims and their families. Singh's unwavering dedication to his job can also make him appear obsessive or even reckless at times. He is willing to take risks and push boundaries to get the evidence he needs, which can sometimes put himself and others in danger. Singh's attention to detail and focus on the case can sometimes lead him to neglect other areas of his life, such as his relationships with family and friends. He can be a workaholic, putting in long hours at the office and sacrificing his personal life for the sake of his job. While Singh is an excellent investigator, he can sometimes struggle with working in a team. His meticulous approach to the case can clash with the more intuitive and creative approaches of his colleagues, leading to conflicts and tension within the team.
    
    - **Detective Hunter Poyner** is a seasoned detective with over 15 years of experience in homicide investigations. She is known for his calm demeanor, but she can be quite stubborn at times, sticking to his initial theories despite evidence to the contrary. Her colleagues respect her for her intelligence and attention to detail, but he can come across as condescending to those who don't share her level of expertise. Detective Poyner approaches each case with an open mind and is committed to finding the truth, no matter where the evidence leads her. Despite the often-gruesome nature of his work, she maintains a sense of humor and a positive outlook on life. Outside of work, she enjoys hiking and spending time with his family. However, her dedication to her work sometimes leads her to neglect her personal life.
    
    - **Detective James Martinez**, 55, the lead investigator on the case, is a seasoned and meticulous professional. With years of experience under his belt, his analytical mind and keen eye for detail make him a formidable detective. His stern demeanor and sharp, observant eyes can seem intimidating, but they hide a deep commitment to justice. Known for his relentless pursuit of the truth, Detective Martinez operates with a firm belief in the importance of facts and evidence, never allowing personal bias to cloud his judgement. His reputation for fairness and integrity is well-known, making him a respected figure in the field.

    ### **Breakthrough Evidence**
    
    This section details the critical piece of evidence that ultimately reveals the killer or dismantles their alibi.
    
    - Type of Evidence: [Physical, digital, forensic, testimonial]
    - Description: [What it is and how it connects to the crime]
    - Discovery: [Where the evidence is located]
    - Impact on the Case: [How it shifts the investigation and points to the real culprit]
    
    ### The Night Of:
    
    - Setting the Scene: Describe what was happening at the time of the murder (event, environment, key people present).
    - Lead-Up to the Crime: Detail interactions between the victim and suspects, building tension.
    - Moment of the Murder: Explain how the culprit executed the crime while covering their tracks.
    - Discovery of the Body: Who found it, what was their reaction, and how the investigation began.

### Timeline:

The Timeline serves as a structured sequence of events tied to key characters, relationships, and actions leading up to the murder. Each event represents a critical turning point, such as a heated argument, the acquisition of a murder weapon, or the last known whereabouts of a suspect. These moments help establish the progression of conflicts and opportunities, making it easier to track alibis and inconsistencies. Every entry in the timeline is converted into a piece of evidence, ensuring that the investigation is built on tangible, discoverable facts rather than speculation.

The culprit’s timeline will contain events covering all three key elements: Means, Motive, and Opportunity, while the other suspects will only have two of the three. This structure ensures that every suspect appears viable, with competing motives and circumstantial evidence, but only one has the complete puzzle that confirms guilt. 

TIMELINE TYPE should be based off of the THEME of the case:

- Crime of Opportunity – A spontaneous murder with no clear premeditation, where the killer acted in the moment.
- Hidden Truth – The murder is part of a larger conspiracy, deception, or long-buried secret that slowly unravels.
- Perfect Alibi – The prime suspect has an airtight alibi, forcing the investigator to find the flaw in their story.
- Disguised Crime – A murder staged to look like an accident, suicide, or natural death.

- The Culprit will always have events for Means, Motive, and Opportunity.
- Other suspects will only have two of the three elements, keeping them viable but incomplete.
- Every event becomes a piece of evidence, reinforcing the investigative process.
- Timestamps and relationships help players track who was where and when.
- Detectives do not need additional events tied to their character.
- A cap of 15 events per case to keep the timeline manageable and focused.

### All Possible Evidence:

There are dozens of different types of evidence, all falling into four primary categories: Physical, Digital and Testimonial. Each piece of evidence is tagged as related to Means, Motive, or Opportunity, ensuring that it is filtered based on how it connects to specific characters and the overarching story.

Each piece of evidence must logically contribute to the case, reinforcing the investigation’s progression by revealing contradictions, confirming alibis, or exposing lies. By structuring evidence through tags and relationships, players can track how each clue fits into the broader mystery, ultimately leading them to the truth.

Each case should be limited to **no more than 20 pieces of evidence** to maintain focus, clarity, and engagement. Too much evidence risks overloading the investigation and prolonged production periods, leading to unnecessary complexity, red herrings that feel arbitrary, and an overwhelming amount of data to sort through.

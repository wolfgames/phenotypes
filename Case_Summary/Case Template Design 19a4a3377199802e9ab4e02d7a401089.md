- **TABLE OF CONTENT**

# Problem Statement

- To define what a Case Template is, where a Case Designer can select one to use to initial setup and generate a specific Case for Public Eye.
- To define all the different categorizes and types that can make up a Case Template, such as the different type of Mystery / Crime narratives, or how the evidence is revealed or discovered by the player.
- To design a system and a structure for a Case Template, that can be easily expanded on and added to

# Overview

As a case designer, you can use Case Templates to describe a case's type and content, define how to tell its story to players, and shape their engagement. 

These templates enable the CaseMaker tool to generate an initial case setup—including the synopsis, characters, timelines, gameplay graph, and evidence assets. The case designer can then refine and test this foundation to create a polished case ready for publication.

Due to the complexity of an interactive PublicEye case, a single template cannot easily cover everything a designer wants to create. A case has multiple components that each need to be identified, defined, and categorized, with each component requiring its own defined types.

# The 4 Pillars of a Case

[https://www.figma.com/board/dxBRozCmde8NklwiwjqW51/Wing-Brainstorm?node-id=498-6108&t=yVG5PASoofm5wygF-4](https://www.figma.com/board/dxBRozCmde8NklwiwjqW51/Wing-Brainstorm?node-id=498-6108&t=yVG5PASoofm5wygF-4)

A Case Template consists of 4 core pillars:

- Story
- Flow
- Facts
- Puzzle

Each pillar has its own defined types, prompts, and templates, allowing it to generate content independently within its domain. Each pillar generates the best version of its "expertise" and can stand on its own without influence from the other pillars.

For example:

- The Story Pillar generates a case's actual story (what happened!), characters, and narratives, based on theme or using pre-defined story type templates like "Twisted Love Triangle" or "McGuffin." It should generate a story/synopsis that's enjoyable to read even without playing the case.
- The Facts Pillar handles the general roles of different evidence types and how they work together in a crime, functioning independently from specific stories or characters. It determines how evidence can imply motive, means, or opportunity in any case, without needing an actual story.
- The Flow Pillar defines player engagement through general game flows and narrative patterns—all without needing specific evidence or story details. These gameplay flows are proven, compelling patterns from other cases.
- The Puzzle Pillar manages gameplay mechanisms that players encounter during a case. These are defined gameplay moments or experiences in our toolbox that we can deploy based on a case's needs.

However, a complete Public Eye Case requires all 4 pillars working in concert. While two pillars working together can produce essential components, the integration of all 4 creates the most engaging playable case.

For example:

- The Story Pillar creates the actual case and characters, but the evidence is generated with the Facts Pillar to define which types of evidence work best with the story.
- Story + Facts create the potential evidence, while the Flow Pillar defines how best to present each piece to the player. All at once? One at a time? Player's choice? Whatever works best for the story the case wants to tell.
- Add the Puzzle Pillar and we can include further engagement mechanisms and constraints for the player and story. Make players complete a mini-game to get evidence, or shape how the Accusation presents its questions for solving the case.

Currently, our cases are generated by starting with Story, then moving to Facts, and finally Flow and Puzzle. In the future, when all pillars have enough defined templates and types, case designers (or generation) should be able to start with either a Flow approach or Puzzle direction if they prefer, letting the other pillars build the case from that foundation instead (***"I really like this Accusation puzzle. Give me a new case with Story and Evidences that works best with that…"***)

- ***OLD 3 Pillar Concept***
    
    [https://www.figma.com/board/dxBRozCmde8NklwiwjqW51/Wing-Brainstorm?node-id=387-8046&t=HdAa0LT8wYImLUc3-4](https://www.figma.com/board/dxBRozCmde8NklwiwjqW51/Wing-Brainstorm?node-id=387-8046&t=HdAa0LT8wYImLUc3-4)
    

## Global Case Parameters

Though each Pillar has its own specific templates and parameters it can set to help generate a case, the Global Case Parameters are sets of parameters that all pillar require initially to help define the case.

<aside>

**Global Case Parameters** that can be set include:

- number of suspects
- difficulty of the case
- length of the case
- etc.
</aside>

And since these parameter affect all 4 pillars, changing them later on may not be possible, as the case generated would rely heavily on them.  Changing them can essentially make brand new cases. 

For example, selecting the number the suspect a case would have:

- generate all the characters and their role for the story
- generate the all the evidence needed each character would have based on their role in the case.
- generate the gameflow to be able to introduce and account for all the characters in the gameplay.

# Story Pillar

The story pillar deals with the actual story of the case, with its fictional events, characters and settings.  By setting some story parameters such as type of crime, and Story Type, it ultimately columates into the Case Synopsis, a breakdown the entire case tells:

- the crime that occurred, such as the type of murder and its murder weapon, and when and where it occurred
- the name and description of all characters involved, including how the all the suspects are related to the victim, and primary role in the case.
- initial set of key events related to case involving each characters
- initial specific key evidence that needs to exist for this case

## Case Synopsis

The Case Synopsis is the overall story and breakdown of whole case, in which the other pillars can use to generated the best sets of Evidences and the best Gameplay to tell that story in a PublicEye Case.  Case Synopsis have the following sections:

- **Synopsis**
- **Theme**
- **Character List - listing each character role in the case, and key events related to the case.**  Characters ****includes:
    - Victim
    - Culprit
    - Other suspects
    - Witnesses
    - Police Officer assigned to the case
- **The Inciting Incident -** the key event(s) that may have been the cause of the crime
- **Means - a list of all thing related to the means of a case, such as:**
    - information on murder weapon, where it was recovered (if so) or disposed
    - who may have owned or know how to use it etc.
- **Motives  -** list of possible motives for all suspects involved, such as
    - primary and secondary motives (if any)
    - escalating factors
- **Opportunity** -  a list of all possible for all  suspects involved, such as
    - if they had Access method
    - if they had any Knowledge advantage
    - if the Timing (was right) factor
- **The Night Of** - a description of the key events and where everyone was right before the time of crime
- **Physical Evidence** - list of all possible key evidence that is part of the case.
- **Timeline** - general timeline of all key events leading up to and related to

- ***Example Case Synopsis - The Wong Case***
    
    **Mei-Ling Wong - 02/15/2028 - Western District**
    
    **Synopsis**
    
    - On February 15, 2028, esteemed herbalist and long-time resident of San Francisco's Hayes Valley, Mei-Ling Wong, was found dead in her family-owned apothecary during the Lunar New Year festivities.
    - The initial investigation by Detective Mira Jensen revealed that the cause of death was blunt force trauma, pointing towards a premeditated and violent crime.
    - Further investigation led to the identification of three suspects, Sophia Wong, with a complex relationship to the victim and potential motives, James Lee, the victim's current boyfriend and contractor, with a grudge against Mei-Ling Wong, and Emily Patel, a young employee who worked with Mei-Ling at the apothecary, with a hidden agenda and struggling with mental health issues, frequently targeted by abrasive verbal attacks from Mei-Ling.
    - Key evidence, including security footage and eyewitness accounts, placed Sophia Wong, James Lee, and Emily Patel at the scene, and their motives for the crime were the fear of losing her family's business, home, and cultural identity due to eviction, a desire for revenge against Mei-Ling Wong for past relationships, and a desire for personal reasons unrelated to taking over the apothecary.

</aside>

### **Adding Key Suspect Statement and MMO**

In addition to the roles of each suspects and in relationship to the crime, each suspect will be making a statement to the police. As well as overview if the player had Means, Motive or Opportunity (MMO).   For each suspect, include

- general role
- their general MMO to the case.
- a simple, to the point, one line statement from each suspect
- indicate a verification to statement, if it is meant to be contradiction or not, based on additional evidence

Here is an example of how the Suspect Statements can look like:

| **Suspect** | Role | **Statement** | **Verification** | Means (Murder Weapon) | Motive (Reason) | Opportunity (Access to Scene) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Mia Carter | Assistant | "I arrived at 10:45 PM and found him already dead. I never saw anyone else." | Contradiction: A witness heard movement at 10:30 PM, suggesting Mia was lying about being the first to find the body. | No | Yes (Financial) | Yes (Discovered body, had key) |
| Daniel Vega | Rival Sculptor | "I was at a gallery opening from 7 PM to 11 PM. Ask anyone." | Confirmed by: Multiple attendees and phone GPS data. | Yes (Strong enough) | Yes (Jealous) | No (Alibi: At gallery openning) |
| Emma Langley | Victim’s Daughter | "I haven't been in my father's studio for weeks." | Confirmed by: No forensic evidence linking her to the scene. | No | Yes (Inheritance) | Yes (Had Studio Key) |
| Graham Porter | Art Collector | "I arrived at 9 PM for our scheduled meeting, but he never answered, so I left." | Contradiction: The clay residue matches Daniel's work, but Graham had access to Daniel's sculptures. | Yes (Frequent) | Yes (Debt to victim) | Yes (Had meeting scheduled) |

### Adding Key Evidence Relevance

For initial evidence setup for this case, to also include its “relevance” to the case.  This will allow the Case Designer a better understand of how the evidence will be used in the case.  

Here is an example of how Evidences can be shown in the Synopsis:

| Type | Evidence | Relevance |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Physical | Heavy metal chisel (murder weapon) | Indicates strength needed to wield it |
| Forensic | Rare clay residue on hands and floor | Matches clay used in Daniel’s recent works |
| Ailibi-Related | Security footage of front entrance | No one entered after 9:00 PM |
| Motive-Revealing | Victor had planned to revoke Graham’s investment | Possible financial motive for Graham |
| Digital | Daniel's GPS phone data | Confirms he was at an art gallery |
| Witness Testimony | Neighbor heard movement at 10:30 PM | Suggests someone was still in the studio |

### Adding Possible Solution Path

With both the new Suspect Statements and Evidence Relevance added, it will make sense to also include a possible logical Solution Path that a player should take to solve the case. 

Here is an example of how a Solution Path can look like (using the examples above):

1. **Daniel Vega is ruled out** – His alibi is airtight with gallery footage and GPS tracking.
2. **Emma Langley is ruled out** – No forensic evidence ties her to the scene, and her inheritance motive was weak.
3. **Mia Carter is suspicious** – She found the body but was inconsistent about the time. However, she lacked the strength to wield the chisel.
4. **Graham Porter is the culprit** – He was in financial distress, had access to Daniel’s clay (found at the scene), and falsely claimed he left at 9 PM. The witness hearing movement at 10:30 PM suggests he stayed behind and staged the crime.
    
    **Final Answer: Graham Porter**
    
    He stayed after the meeting, used a chisel from the studio, and attempted to frame Daniel by using clay from one of his stolen sculptures. His financial desperation and opportunity make him the true culprit.
    

This can also help the Case Designer and generation come up with the best gameplay and evidence for this case. 

<aside>

**PLEASE NOTE:**  This information is to help with the initial direction and generation of the suspects and evidence, for Gameplay purposes, and is subject to changes and tuning by the Case Designer for the final version of this case.

    ### **Case Title:** *The Locked Studio Murder*
    
    ---
    
    ### **A. Scenario**
    
    At 10:45 PM, renowned sculptor **Victor Langley** was found dead in his private art studio, located on the top floor of a secured building. His assistant, **Mia Carter**, discovered the body when she arrived for a late-night delivery. The cause of death: a fatal blow to the head with one of his own metal chisels.
    
    The room was **locked from the inside**, and no security footage shows anyone entering or leaving after 9:00 PM. However, a **window was slightly open**, and a **rare clay residue** was found on the victim’s hands and the floor near his desk.
    
    Detectives must determine how the killer gained entry, their motive, and what key piece of evidence contradicts their statement.

    ### **E. Solution Breakdown**
    
    1. **Daniel Vega is ruled out** – His alibi is airtight with gallery footage and GPS tracking.
    2. **Emma Langley is ruled out** – No forensic evidence ties her to the scene, and her inheritance motive was weak.

- **Example 2 of Case with similar Synopsis additions**
    
    ### **Case Title:** *The Ming Dynasty Heist*
    
    ### **A. Scenario**
    
    A priceless **Ming Dynasty vase** was stolen from the **Metropolitan Museum's East Asian exhibition** during a preview gala. The theft occurred **between 11:00 PM and 11:30 PM**, with the security system disabled for exactly 8 minutes. The vase was **carefully removed without triggering backup sensors**, and trace amounts of metallic dust were found near the display case. The museum had **three suspects**, each with different levels of means, motive, and opportunity.
    
    ### **B. Suspects**
    
    | Name | Role | Means | Motive | Opportunity |
    | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
    | **Marcus Chen** | Exhibition Curator | Yes | Yes | No |
    | **Sarah Reynolds** | Head of Security | Yes | Yes | No |
    | **James Morrison** | Climate Technician | Yes | Yes | Yes |
    
    ### **C. Evidence**
    
    | Type | Evidence | Relevance |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | **Digital** | Security log showing override with Sarah's credentials | Indicates security breach method |
    | **Service** | Emergency maintenance request at 10:30 PM | Places Morrison on scene |
    | **Physical** | Metallic dust matching climate control cleaning compound | Links to maintenance systems |
    | **Witness** | Anonymous tip about maintenance uniform in security office | Connects different locations |
    | **Financial** | Sarah's gambling debts and loan applications | Potential motive for theft |
    | **Video** | Security footage showing Sarah's card used without her present | Questions apparent suspect |
    
    ### **D. Suspect Statements**
    
    **Marcus Chen (Curator):**
    
    - *"I left at 10:45 PM to go home. I wouldn't risk my career in Asian arts."*
    - Confirmed by gala attendees and exit logs.
    
    **Sarah Reynolds (Security):**
    
    - *"I was on my dinner break from 11:00-11:30 PM."*
    - Confirmed by cafeteria staff and cameras.
    
    **James Morrison (Technician):**
    
    - *"I was just responding to an emergency temperature control issue."*
    - Contradiction: His movements don't match typical maintenance patterns.
    
    ### **E. Solution Breakdown**
    
    1. **Marcus is ruled out** because he left before the theft and lacks technical expertise.
    2. **Sarah is ruled out** despite her credentials being used, as video proves she wasn't present.
    3. **James is the culprit** because:
        - He had **means** (access to service corridors and technical knowledge).
        - He had **motive** (company facing bankruptcy).
        - He had **opportunity** (legitimate reason to be present).
        - The **metallic dust** directly links to his work area.
        - He could access the **security office** during his maintenance rounds.
        
        🔍 **Final Answer:** *James Morrison is the thief!*
        
        This case demonstrates classic means/motive/opportunity analysis with physical evidence corroboration and the clever use of a legitimate service call as cover for the crime.

</aside>

Here is a list of Story Types as how its defined as categories and content in CaseMaker, in which a Case Synopsis and Characters are generated from.  This list also includes new possible Story Types that can be added to CaseMaker.

[Story Types (1)](Case%20Template%20Design%2019a4a3377199802e9ab4e02d7a401089/Story%20Types%20(1)%2019a4a33771998049bd4ade77ecb06e43.csv)

# Evidence Pillar

The Evidence pillar deals with all things related to evidence.  In this pillar, all the many different types of evidences are defined, and how evidences can relate and work with each other.  On evidence alone, this pillar will understand what makes good evidences in a case, regardless of story or how the gameplay can reveal it (case is solved as if all evidence is now available).

## Evidence vs. Clue

Lets make a clear distinction between piece of Evidence and a Clue:

A **piece of evidence** is any factual object, document, statement, or data point collected during an investigation. It is raw information that exists independently of interpretation.

A **clue** is an inferred or deductive insight derived from one or more pieces of evidence. It connects evidence to the larger mystery, helping the investigator understand motives, contradictions, or hidden truths.

**Example:**

- **Evidence**: A torn movie ticket stub found in the victim's pocket.
- **Clue**: The victim attended a late-night movie, contradicting a suspect’s claim that they were together at home all evening.

In this game, players would gather **evidence** and then use logic and categorization to derive **clues**, which ultimately lead to solving the case.

## Defining Evidence Categories and Types

Because cases are so varied, with almost anything can be a piece of evidence in a case, it also good to define and breakdown what a Evidence can be.  But there are many possible ways to do so, from what it “physically” is, to how it relates to Means, Motive and Opportunity and to how the the different evidence in a case can to relate or behave with one another. 

## General Evidence Type

This is a general breakdown of what an evidence can be, in regards to its “physical” presence.  As well as trying to “parameterize” into categorizes that can also help define each of these types and its purpose. 

| **Evidence Type** | **Examples** | **Purpose in Case** | **How it Guides Investigation** | **Reliability** | **Clarity** | **Supports Means, Motive, or Opportunity** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Physical Evidence | Murder weapon, broken window, single glove at the scene | Establishes presence, actions, or struggle | Direct Link | High | Clear or Obscured | Means, Opportunity |
| Forensic Evidence | DNA under victim's nails, toxins in autopsy, blood spatter analysis | Links people or actions scientifically | Direct Link | High | Precise or Inconclusive | Means |
| Digital Location Evidence | GPS history, ride-sharing records, geotagged photos, phone location data, CCTV images and footage | Establishes presence, movement, or timeline gaps | Requires Cross-Reference | Medium-High | Precise or Misleading | Opportunity |
| Digital Communication Evidence | Deleted texts, call logs, emails, social media threats | Reveals conflicts, intent, premeditation | Requires Cross-Reference | Medium | Verifiable or Subjective | Motive, Opportunity |
| Testimonial Evidence | Witness statements, suspect's alibi, conflicting accounts | Establishes timelines, inconsistencies, or corroborations | Requires Cross-Reference | Low-Medium | Contradictory or Consistent | Opportunity |
| Behavioral Evidence | Sudden behavior change, history of violence, restraining orders, unusual spending | Suggests psychological state, potential for crime | Suggestive, needs supporting evidence | Low-Medium | Interpretable or Ambiguous | Motive |
| Financial & Transactional Clues | Large money transfer, altered records, sudden debt payments | Establishes motive, secret dealings | Requires Cross-Reference | Medium | Verifiable or Misleading | Motive |
| Official Records & Documentation | Last will, police reports, leases, contracts, medical records, employment records | Establishes legal, financial, or historical facts relevant to the case | Requires Verification | High | Clear or Subject to Interpretation | Means, Motive, Opportunity |
| Partial & Misleading Evidence | Torn-up note, misplaced items, fake alibi, irrelevant red herrings | Creates ambiguity, introduces distractions | Creates a Red Herring | Low | Fragmented or Misdirecting | Depends on Context |

### **Logical Deduction Flowchart**

With the generalize evidence type above, it can be used to defined patterns that can be used to help with Evidence puzzle creation.  As such, there is a possible Logical Deduction Flowchart or path that can be followed where 2 or more evidence or clues to either confirm or contradict certain information in the case.  For example:

1. **Physical Evidence + Digital Location Evidence → Confirmation of Last Known Actions**
    
    *(Example: A murder weapon found at the scene + GPS history placing a suspect nearby confirms presence.)*
    
2. **Testimonial Evidence + Contradictory Location Evidence → Expose a Lie or Hidden Information**
    
    *(Example: A witness states they saw the suspect at a location, but security footage or location proof can contradicts the claim.)*
    
3. **Financial & Transactional Clues + Motive Analysis → Identify a Possible Reason for the Crime**
    
    *(Example: A sudden debt payment + a life insurance payout suggests financial motivation.)*
    
4. **Forensic Evidence + Suspect’s Access to Tools or Means → Eliminate or Confirm Suspect**
    
    *(Example: DNA under the victim’s nails + a suspect owning a matching weapon strengthens direct involvement.)*
    
5. **Partial & Misleading Evidence + Cross-Referenced Official Records or Documentation → Clarify Intent or Red Herring**
    
    *(Example: A torn-up note + a verified will or lease agreement may reveal a hidden conflict or disprove a misleading clue.)*
    
6. **Digital Communication Evidence + Behavioral Evidence → Establish Premeditation or Emotional Trigger**
    
    *(Example: Threatening texts + a suspect exhibiting erratic behavior suggest planning or emotional motive.)*
    

### Specific Evidence Motive, Means and Opportunity (MMO) Type

This a more specific breakdown of the many different types Means, Motives and Opportunity, followed by the general or generic evidence that are typically related to it.  

[Untitled](Case%20Template%20Design%2019a4a3377199802e9ab4e02d7a401089/Untitled%2019a4a3377199808ba7cfe483b02825e7.csv)

## **Evidence Behavior or Archetypes**

A new type of evidence to categorize is the **Evidence Archetypes** define what pieces of evidences or clues role in a case, from revealing the truth to creating misdirection. Some evidence is definitive, while others require deeper analysis or lead to false conclusions. But all help with evidence puzzle design that force players to piece it all together. 

**Key Parameters Defining Evidence Behavior**

- **Reliability:** (High, Medium, Low, Variable) – How trustworthy or definitive the evidence is in solving the case. High-reliability evidence provides clear, concrete proof, while low-reliability evidence may be misleading or require further corroboration.
- **Purpose in the Case:** (Confirming, Misleading, Revealing, Challenging) – The role the evidence plays in guiding the player’s investigation. Some evidence confirms guilt, while others introduce twists or complications.
- **Potential to Mislead:** (Low, Medium, High) – The likelihood that the evidence will lead the player to a false conclusion or distract from the real solution.
- **Link to Culprit:** (Direct, Indirect, None) – Whether the evidence directly implicates the true culprit, only suggests involvement, or is completely unrelated.
- **Requires Additional Corroboration?:** (Yes, No) – Whether the evidence alone is sufficient to draw conclusions or needs supporting information to be useful.
- **Emotional/Contextual Impact:** (Satisfying, Frustrating, Suspenseful, Tense) – The narrative effect of the evidence on the player’s experience and progression in the mystery.
- **Means, Motive, or Opportunity:** (Means, Motive, Opportunity, Any) – Defines whether the evidence links to how the crime was committed (Means), why it was committed (Motive), or when/where it was committed (Opportunity). Some evidence types can relate to multiple aspects or none at all.

| **Archetype** | **Description** | **Common Interpretation** | **Reliability** | **Purpose in the Case** | **Potential to Mislead** | **Link to Culprit** | **Requires Additional Corroboration?** | **Emotional / Contextual Impact** | **Means, Motive, or Opportunity** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **The Smoking Gun** | Direct and conclusive evidence pointing to the perpetrator. | "This proves everything!" | High | Confirms guilt beyond doubt. | None | Direct | No | Satisfying, but often hidden or difficult to obtain. | Means, Motive |
| **The Red Herring** | Misleading evidence that diverts suspicion away from the real culprit. | "This changes everything... or does it?" | Low | Designed to trick investigators into false leads. | High | Indirect or None | Yes | Frustrating, often placed intentionally. | Any (but false) |
| **The Missing Link** | A crucial but absent piece of evidence that, once found, ties the case together. | "Something’s missing here..." | Medium | Creates an investigative gap until discovered. | Medium | Direct | Yes | Keeps investigators searching. | Means, Opportunity |
| **The Contradictory Statement** | Witness testimony or documents that conflict with each other. | "Someone’s lying, but who?" | Variable | Forces the player to evaluate credibility. | High | Indirect | Yes | Builds tension and requires logical deduction. | Opportunity |
| **The Incriminating Object** | An item found at the crime scene or on a suspect that makes them look guilty. | "Why would they have this?" | Medium | Draws suspicion but may have alternative explanations. | Medium | Indirect | Yes | Can cause initial misdirection. | Means, Opportunity |
| **The Overlooked Detail** | A minor or seemingly insignificant clue that becomes crucial later. | "This didn’t seem important at first..." | High | Requires re-examination to reveal its full meaning. | Low | Direct | Yes | Creates an "aha!" moment for players. | Any |
| **The Confession Letter** | A written or verbal admission of guilt—possibly fake or misleading. | "It’s a confession, but is it real?" | Variable | Can be a red herring or a genuine admission. | High | Indirect or Direct | Yes | Can introduce doubt or false closure. | Motive |
| **The Forged Document** | A falsified piece of evidence designed to alter the course of the investigation. | "This paperwork doesn’t add up." | Low | Deliberate deception by another suspect. | High | Indirect | Yes | Causes confusion and forces re-evaluation. | Any (but false) |
| **The Unreliable Witness** | Testimony that is either vague, contradictory, or influenced by bias. | "I think I saw something... maybe?" | Low | Can add complexity or steer investigators in the wrong direction. | High | Indirect | Yes | Creates uncertainty and potential for narrative twists. | Opportunity |
| **The Alibi Breaker** | Evidence that disproves or weakens a suspect’s alibi. | "Wait a second... they weren’t where they said they were!" | High | Crucial for eliminating false alibis. | Low | Direct | No | Satisfying, but needs careful validation. | Opportunity |
| **The Time Discrepancy** | A timeline inconsistency that suggests a suspect or event is not as claimed. | "The times don’t match up!" | High | Forces players to reconstruct the timeline. | Medium | Indirect | Yes | Often a slow-burn reveal. | Opportunity |
| **The Planted Evidence** | A piece of evidence deliberately placed to frame someone. | "Why is this too perfect?" | Low | Used by another suspect to shift blame. | High | Indirect | Yes | Creates mistrust and deepens the mystery. | Any (but false) |
| **The DNA Trace** | Biological evidence that links someone to the crime scene. | "This proves they were there!" | High | Places a person at a location, but doesn’t confirm guilt. | Low | Direct | Yes | Scientific, but often requires context. | Opportunity |
| **The Hidden Message** | A coded note, cryptic text, or secret communication found in the case. | "There’s something hidden here..." | Medium | Adds depth to the investigation, requiring decryption or interpretation. | Medium | Indirect | Yes | Provides intellectual challenge and suspense. | Motive |
| **The Personal Connection** | Evidence that establishes a suspect’s relationship to the victim. | "They knew each other well..." | Medium | Establishes motive or prior interaction. | Low | Indirect | Sometimes | Can shift perceptions of suspects. | Motive |
| **The Last-Minute Discovery** | A late-game clue that changes everything. | "Wait, this changes everything!" | High | Often resolves an impasse in the investigation. | Medium | Direct | No | Creates dramatic tension. | Any |
| **The Cover-Up Attempt** | Evidence that someone tried to erase or alter crucial information. | "They didn’t want us to see this..." | High | Suggests knowledge of guilt, even if not from the true culprit. | Medium | Indirect | Yes | Raises stakes and urgency. | Any |
| **The False Memory** | Witness testimony that has been altered due to trauma or suggestion. | "I could have sworn..." | Low | Can lead investigators in the wrong direction. | High | Indirect | Yes | Adds psychological depth to the case. | Any |
| **The Unintentional Clue** | A clue left behind without the culprit realizing its significance. | "They didn’t mean to leave this..." | High | A genuine lead that points in the right direction. | Low | Direct | No | Gives a realistic break in the case. | Any |
| **The Reverse Motive** | Evidence suggesting the crime was committed for an unexpected reason. | "We had it all wrong..." | High | Forces a reinterpretation of the case. | Medium | Direct | Yes | Creates a major twist. | Motive |
| **The Witness Corroboration** | Multiple sources confirming the same fact. | "They all saw the same thing." | High | Solidifies details in the investigation. | Low | Indirect | No | Provides clarity and confidence. | Opportunity |
| **The Surveillance Footage** | Video evidence that provides a direct or partial view of the crime. | "It’s on camera!" | High | Can confirm locations, actions, or identities. | Low | Direct | Sometimes | Often used as a final proof piece. | Opportunity |
| **The Emotional Artifact** | A personal object with sentimental value that adds narrative depth. | "This meant something to them..." | Medium | Adds character motivation but not necessarily guilt. | Low | Indirect | Yes | Creates an emotional connection. | Motive |

## Suspect Archetype

Similar to Evidence Archetype, there could be defined **Suspect Archetype** categorizes individuals based on key behavioral parameters defining their behavior or role in a case.  Some suspects may appear guilty but are red herrings, while others benefit from the crime but may not be the true culprit. By defining these different roles, will give us better ways to define how a case should be, and to be more engaging to the player with different types in every case. 

**Key Parameters Defining Suspect Behavior**

- **Motive Strength:** (Strong, Weak, Indirect) – How much the suspect stands to gain or lose from the crime.
- **Deception Level:** (Honest, Half-Truth, Full Liar) – How truthful the suspect is in their statements.
- **Alibi Strength:** (Confirmed, Unconfirmed, Contradicted) – The credibility of their alibi.
- **Knowledge of the Crime:** (None, Partial, Full) – How much the suspect knows about what actually happened.
- **Red Herring Potential:** (Low, Medium, High) – The likelihood of misleading the player into suspecting them falsely.
- **Emotional State:** (Calm, Nervous, Defensive, Overly Cooperative) – How the suspect presents themselves during questioning.

| **Archetype** | **Description** | **Common Statement** | **Role in the Case** | **Motive Strength** | **Deception Level** | **Alibi Strength** | **Knowledge of the Crime** | **Red Herring Potential** | **Emotional State** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **The Primary Suspect (The Obvious Red Herring)** | Appears guilty but is likely innocent. | *"I know how this looks, but I swear I had nothing to do with it."* | Often framed or falsely accused, requiring players to investigate further. | Strong | Medium | Partial or Contradicted | Partial | Medium | Defensive |
| **The Secretive Insider (Has Hidden Knowledge)** | Knows more than they admit but may not be directly involved. | *"I don’t want to get involved, but something wasn’t right that night."* | Withholds key information out of fear, guilt, or self-preservation. | Medium | High | Unconfirmed | Partial | High | Nervous |
| **The Opportunist (Benefits from the Crime)** | Stands to gain something from the victim’s demise but isn’t necessarily guilty. | *"It’s tragic what happened, but I had no reason to hurt them."* | Suspicious due to their gain but not necessarily the culprit. | Strong | Medium | Confirmed | None | Medium | Calm |
| **The Liar (Has an Alibi That Doesn’t Hold Up)** | Provides a statement that contradicts other evidence or witnesses. | *"I was nowhere near them that night—I was at home."* | Might be covering for someone else or trying to avoid suspicion. | Weak | High | Contradicted | None | High | Overly Cooperative |
| **The Unexpected Threat (A Hidden Connection to the Crime)** | Initially appears unimportant but has a deeper link to the crime. | *"I barely knew them, why would I care?"* | Can be the actual culprit or someone indirectly responsible. | Indirect | Medium | Unconfirmed | Full | Medium | Defensive |
| **The Altruistic Witness (Appears Helpful but May Mislead)** | Wants to assist the investigation but may mislead unintentionally. | *"I just want justice for them, but I might have missed some details."* | Can misdirect the player unintentionally or intentionally. | None | Low | Confirmed | Partial | Low | Calm |
| **The Accidental Witness (Saw Something but Won’t Talk)** | Was near the crime but is reluctant to share details. | *"I was just passing by—I didn’t see anything important."* | Holds key knowledge but may be unwilling to reveal it. | None | Medium | Confirmed | Partial | Medium | Nervous |
| **The Complicit Partner (Helped Cover Up the Crime)** | Did not commit the crime but helped hide evidence. | *"I had nothing to do with this. You won’t find anything on me."* | Has direct involvement but isn’t the actual culprit. | Weak | High | Contradicted | Full | High | Defensive |
| **The Double Crosser (Framed Someone Else for the Crime)** | Manipulated evidence or testimony to incriminate another suspect. | *"I heard that [another suspect] had a serious problem with them."* | Tries to shift blame onto another suspect to protect themselves. | Medium | High | Partial | Full | High | Overly Cooperative |
| **The Unreliable Informant (Gives Conflicting or Inaccurate Details)** | Provides information that is inconsistent or contradicts evidence. | *"I think they were wearing a dark jacket… or maybe it was light?"* | Creates confusion in the investigation but may not be malicious. | None | Low | Unconfirmed | Partial | High | Nervous |
| **The Desperate Innocent (Panicked and Destroyed Evidence)** | Innocent but acted suspiciously due to fear. | *"I was scared! I didn’t do anything wrong!"* | Looks guilty but was only reacting out of panic. | None | Medium | Contradicted | None | Medium | Defensive |
| **The Unwitting Accomplice (Unknowingly Helped the Killer)** | Assisted the real culprit without realizing it. | *"They asked me to drop something off, but I had no idea what was going on."* | A pawn in the crime but unaware of its true purpose. | Weak | Medium | Confirmed | Partial | Medium | Calm |
| **The Secret Rival (Hid a Personal Vendetta Against the Victim)** | Kept a personal grudge secret but didn’t commit the crime. | *"We didn’t exactly get along, but I wouldn’t hurt them."* | Seems to have motive but isn’t directly involved in the crime. | Strong | Medium | Confirmed | None | Medium | Defensive |
| **The Emotional Wild Card (Highly Reactive and Erratic Behavior)** | Displays extreme emotions that make them appear suspicious. | *"I don’t know what happened! I just... I can’t deal with this!"* | Not necessarily guilty but unpredictable and hard to read. | None | Low | Unconfirmed | Partial | High | Overly Cooperative |

## Evidence Puzzle

# Gameplay Pillar

- **~~Narrator Type:** in how ADA (narrator) tells the story and how it relates to the player.~~
    - ~~such as time of crime (immediately after or much later), is the where is the player?  and how ADA will talk with the player~~
- **~~Gameplay Flow and Components:**  in how evidences is presented or discovered by the player~~
    - ~~including type of gameplay they can encounter (such as a locked phone puzzle)~~

# **Narrator Type**

This defines how ADA (narrator) tells the story to the player, or how they talk to the player.  As well as how and where the player is helping.

These include:

- when the does the case take place relative to the present?
    - such as time of the crime (crime just happened, or this was a past case)
    - has the case been solved?
- where the player is at for this case
    - are they at the crime scene, or “visiting” different locations
    - are they just on their phone?
- how the player “gets” evidences?
    - does the player “discovers” the evidences themselves?
    - or, does the player just get or earn (unlock) the already available evidence?

# **Gameplay Flow**

This is how the player will “play the case”, which includes:

- in how evidences is presented or discovered by the player, thru ADA
    - does ADA give players one evidence (linearly) at time, or a bunch of evidence is given at once, for the player to review in the order they choose
- when and how interactive or mini-game components are given to the player
    - such as allow players to choose from 3 interviews at this point in the case
    - or there, will be a locked phone puzzle, in which gates some evidence and/or blocks the story from moving forward
- and when and how the player will be able to “solve” the case.
    - when Accusation will unlock and the type of Accusation they need to solve.

</aside>

### **Time Cave**

A heavily-branching sequence. All choices are of roughly equal significance; there is little or no re-merging, and therefore no need for state-tracking. There are many, many endings.

![](https://heterogenoustasks.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/timecaveb.png?w=640&h=118)

***Effects:*** 

The time cave is the oldest and most obvious CYOA structure. It is often good for narratives about freedom and open possibility, adventures that could go *anywhere,* flights of fancy. Time caves tend to have relatively short playthroughs, but strongly encourage replay: they are broad rather than long. Even with multiple playthroughs, most players will probably miss a good deal of the content.

The time cave’s structure is both organised by chronological progression and detached from it. It’s ungrounded by regularity: possibility is *so* open that it often becomes fantastic or surreal, with different branches occupying wholly different realities. The player has velocity but little grasp, vast freedom but little ability to comprehend it.

***Examples:*** 

Edward Packard’s earlier work ([The Cave of Time](https://heterogenoustasks.wordpress.com/2011/08/05/cyoa-structures-the-cave-of-time/)*,* [Sugarcane Island](https://heterogenoustasks.wordpress.com/2011/08/10/cyoa-structures-more-packard/)), Emily Short’s [A dark and stormy entry](https://heterogenoustasks.wordpress.com/2011/08/24/cyoa-structure-if/); [Pretty Little Mistakes](https://heterogenoustasks.wordpress.com/2012/04/04/cyoa-structure-millennial-snark/)*.*

### **Gauntlet**

Long rather than broad, gauntlets have a relatively linear central thread, pruned by branches which end in death, backtracking, or quick rejoining. The Gauntlet generally tells one anointed story, which can be adorned with optional content or prematurely ended with failure; if there are multiple endings, they’re likely to derive from a Final Choice. Gauntlets rarely rely on state to any great extent (if they do, they are likely to evolve into a branch-and-bottleneck structure.)

![](https://heterogenoustasks.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/gauntlet.png?w=640&h=139)

***Effects:*** 

The player is likely to realise that they are on a constrained path, but the presentation of side-branches matters a great deal – do they mean death? incorrect answers? travel back in time? blocked paths, footnotes,  or scenic details? Most often, **the gauntlet creates an atmosphere of a hazardous, difficult or constrained world. Sometimes this can be punishing or depressing; sometimes it can be darkly comic; sometimes it’s a sign that you’re in a work heavily dependent on reflective or rhetorical choice. Perhaps the easiest structure to author, gauntlets can be conceived of in similar terms to linear stories, and ensure that most players will see most of the important content.

There are two major varieties of gauntlet: deadly and friendly. Deadly gauntlets mostly prune the tree with *failure*; friendly ones mostly do so with short-range rejoining, and look a bit more like simple *branch-and-bottleneck* structures. Friendly gauntlets have been vastly more common in recent years, making up a high proportion of Twine works.

### **Branch and Bottleneck**

The game branches, but the branches regularly rejoin, usually around events that are common to all versions of the story. To avoid obliterating the effect of past choices, branch-and-bottleneck structures almost always rely on heavy use of state-tracking (if a game doesn’t do this, chances are you are dealing with a gauntlet).

Somewhat rarely, the bottlenecks may be invisible – the plot branches and never reaches an explicit rejoining node, but the choices at the end of each branch are the same or similar, creating an exquisite-corpse effect.

***Effects:***

 **Branch-and-bottleneck games tend to be heavily governed by the passage of time, while still allowing the player fairly strong grasp. **The branch-and-bottleneck structure is most often used to reflect the growth of the player-character: it allows the player to construct a somewhat-distinctive story and/or personality, while still allowing for a manageable plot. There’s a tendency – not a necessary one, by any means – for playthroughs to be very similar in the early game, then diverge as the effects of earlier choices accumulate. In order for the approach to work, it has to be used in a fairly large piece; you need time to accumulate change before producing results that reflect it.

***Examples:*** 

This is pretty much how [Long Live the Queen](https://heterogenoustasks.wordpress.com/2014/12/13/long-live-the-queen/) works, and is the guiding principle of [Choice of Games](https://heterogenoustasks.wordpress.com/2015/01/26/standard-patterns-in-choice-based-games/choiceofgames.com) (Dan Fabulich uses the term [*delayed branching*](https://www.choiceofgames.com/2011/07/by-the-numbers-how-to-write-a-long-interactive-novel-that-doesnt-suck/)). It’s also a common plot structure in non-IF games that allow significant plot choices.

**Quest**

The quest structure forms distinct branches, though they tend to rejoin to reach a relatively small number of winning endings (often only one). The elements of these branches have a modular structure: small, tightly-grouped clusters of nodes allowing many ways to approach a single situation, with lots of interconnection within each cluster and relatively little outside it. Re-merging is fairly common; backtracking rather less so. Quests generally involve some level of state-tracking, and do poorly when they don’t. The minimal size for a quest is relatively large, and this category includes some of the largest CYOAs.

***Effects:*** 

This mode is well-suited for journeys of exploration, focused on setting; the quest’s structure tends to be organized by geography rather than time. Indeed, most works of this kind involve a journey with a specific purpose in mind. Quests work well for grounded, consistent worlds, but within that context the player-character’s situation is constantly changing. The narrative tends to be fragmentary or episodic, like old-school D&D encounters: little chunks of story which might not have any great significance for the big picture.

*Examples:* 

The *Fighting Fantasy* books and their descendants ([Lone Wolf](https://heterogenoustasks.wordpress.com/2011/08/17/cyoa-structures-cyo-rpg/), [80 Days](https://heterogenoustasks.wordpress.com/2014/08/24/80-days-the-map-is-the-territory/)*).*

### **Open Map**

Even though quests are structured by geography, time still plays an important part: there’s a built-in direction of travel. But take a CYOA structure, make travel between the major nodes reversible, and you have a static geography, a world in which the player can toodle about indefinitely. Often this is a *literal* geography and relies on extensive state-tracking both explicit and secret for narrative progress. But it’s not an uncommon mode for things with assumptions grounded in the hypertext-novel idiom – static but non-linear works like [Le Reprobateur](http://www.francoiscoulon.com/le_reprobateur.html)*.*

***Effects:*** 

This is often used as an imitation of the default style of parser IF, although some may be parallel derivation from the former’s D&D roots. As with classic map-based parser games, the narrative tends to become slower-paced and less directed; the player has more leisure to explore and grasp the world, but spends less of their time advancing the story.

*Examples:* 

*Duelmaster*; [Chemistry and Physics](http://ifdb.tads.org/viewgame?id=qfvfc6576i90py4w)*.*

### **Sorting Hat**

The early game branches heavily and rejoins heavily (branch-and-bottleneck is a likely model here), ultimately determining which major branch the player gets assigned to. These major branches are typically quite linear – sometimes they look like gauntlets, but they might be choiceless straight-shots. Sorting Hats almost always rely substantially on state-tracking in the early game, and often bottleneck at the decision point.

***Effects:*** 

The Sorting Hat is a compromise between the breadth of more open formats and the depth of linear ones. Sometimes the nature of the various branches is signaled to the player; this is kind of important, in fact, because the player is pretty likely to notice the linearity of the second half and might assume that *all* of their choices will ultimately get funneled into that particular thread. The player gets a *lot* of influence over how the story goes; however, the author may end up effectively having to write several different games.

***Examples:***

### **Floating Modules**

A mode only really possible in computer-based works. There is no tree – or, while there may be scattered twigs and branches, there’s no trunk. No central plot, no through-line: modular encounters become available to the player based largely on state, or perhaps randomly.

***Effects:*** 

This is a challenging style to write for, both because it’s difficult to intuitively grasp – writers tend to rebound quickly to a more unified structure – and because few assumptions can ever be made about prior events. Without a large amount of content, the method tends to collapse into a linear system. Because play mechanics are largely about altering stats in order to negotiate a world, there’s a strong incentive to expose those stats to the player; repeated events chosen only to affect a stat (grinding) may be a feature.

There are different approaches to floating-module: [Emily Short has a tentative categorisation here](https://emshort.wordpress.com/2016/04/12/beyond-branching-quality-based-and-salience-based-narrative-structures/).

***Examples:*** 

Pure examples of modular design are relatively rare. [King of Chicago](http://web.archive.org/web/20040404061317/www.channelzilch.com/doug/battle.htm) (hat-tip Sean Barrett) is an early example. [StoryNexus](http://storynexus.com/s) and its conceptual relatives (e.g. [Bee](http://varytale.com/books/book/short-bee/info/)) inhabit this space, though they generally impose some more linear-progression structure on it. (Alexis Kennedy uses the term [quality-based narrative](http://www.failbettergames.com/storynexus-developer-diary-2-fewer-spreadsheets-less-swearing/) to describe the general approach: ‘pieces of story like mosaic tiles, not pipes or complex machinery.’)

### **Loop and Grow**

The game has a central thread of some kind, which loops around, over and over, to the same point: but thanks to state-tracking, each time around new options may be unlocked and others closed off. This is a very general pattern, and can co-exist with many others. *Trapped in Time*, for instance, is basically a cycle-and-growing Gauntlet; *Bee* tames its floating-module nature with a year-long loop structure.

![](https://heterogenoustasks.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/cyclegrow.png?w=640)

***Effects:*** 

Loop and Grow emphasizes the regularity of the world while retaining narrative momentum. A justification is needed for why whole sections of narrative can repeat: the player-character is often following routine activities in a familiar space, engaged in time-travel, or performing tasks at a certain level of abstraction. This regularity often comes at the price of openness: many stories with a strong Loop and Grow structure involve a struggle against confinement or stagnation.

An important variation of loop-and-grow structures is **spoke and hub:** the game has several major branches, but they all originate at and return to a central node or set of nodes. The player may go out along each spoke once, or many times.

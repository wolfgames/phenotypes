Exhaustive Level Design Guidelines for Staging Cases

Core Goal: To meticulously stage each individual 10-minute case as a deeply compelling, self-contained investigative microcosm. Each case must be immediately intuitive, relentlessly engaging from the very first second, respectful of the player's limited time, and aesthetically polished, consistently adhering to the established "Law & Order" inspired tone and mobile-first design principles.

I. Case Initiation & Framing: The Irresistible First Impression

Guideline 1: Start with an Irresistible Hook & Clear Objective (Lens #13: Curiosity; TikTok/Reels Principle)

Core Principle: The absolute instant a player opens a new case, they must be confronted with a visual and textual combination so intriguing, provocative, or emotionally resonant that clicking "Accept Case" feels like an immediate, undeniable necessity. This opening is paramount; it's the gateway to engagement and must function like the perfect, attention-grabbing opening frame of viral short-form content.

Why It Matters: In a mobile environment with endless distractions, the first 1-3 seconds are critical. A weak opening means the player might immediately swipe away or close the widget. This hook leverages innate human curiosity and the desire to resolve cognitive dissonance or mystery. It sets the emotional and narrative tone for the entire 10-minute experience.

Visual Hook - Specific Implementation:

Single, Powerful Image: The introductory screen must feature one dominant, high-impact image. This is not a generic establishing shot.

Intriguing Detail: Focus on a visually arresting detail unique to this case. Examples:

A close-up of an unusual murder weapon (e.g., an antique letter opener, a specific tool used improperly).

A single, poignant object left at the scene (e.g., a child's dropped toy, a single, symbolic flower).

A visually striking piece of evidence with inherent mystery (e.g., a torn photograph showing only half a face, a coded message scrawled on a mirror).

A symbolic juxtaposition (e.g., a shattered award plaque next to blood spatter, a wedding ring lying discarded).

Emotional Resonance: The image should ideally evoke an immediate emotional response – intrigue, shock, sadness, confusion.

Avoid: Generic crime scene tape, distant shots of bodies covered by sheets, standard police lights. These are clichés and lack specific intrigue.

Textual Hook - Specific Implementation:

The First Line is Everything: The very first sentence presented by the ADA must be sharp, concise, and instantly captivating. It complements the visual hook.

Provocative Phrasing: Use techniques like:

Direct Questions: "A charity gala turns deadly. Was the poisoned philanthropist hiding a dark secret?"

Shocking Statements: "He claimed self-defense, but the victim was shot three times in the back."

Intriguing Paradoxes: "She had no enemies, yet someone meticulously planned her disappearance."

Stark Contrasts: "A tech billionaire found dead in a squalid motel. What was he doing there?"

Personal Stakes (Implied): "The only witness is the victim's traumatized child. Can you decipher their drawings?"

Conciseness: Aim for 1-2 short, impactful sentences maximum for the initial hook text. Further synopsis details can follow briefly, but the hook comes first.

Clear Objective - Specific Implementation:

Immediately following the hook, state the player's primary goal succinctly. Examples: "Identify the killer," "Find the missing evidence," "Break the suspect's alibi," "Uncover the true motive." This provides immediate direction.

"Accept Case" Button: Position this button clearly. Tapping it should feel like a conscious decision to dive into the presented mystery, driven by the hook's effectiveness.

Pitfalls to Avoid: Vague descriptions ("A body was found..."), burying the hook under lengthy exposition, using weak or generic visuals, failing to state a clear player objective early.

Intended Player Feeling: Instant intrigue, burning curiosity, a feeling of "I need to know what happened here," clear understanding of the immediate task.

II. Information Presentation & Investigation: Unpeeling the Onion

Guideline 2: Provide a Starting Point (Not Everything) (Lens #13: Curiosity)

Core Principle: Avoid overwhelming the player with an immediate data dump. Instead, present a curated initial set of information that establishes the basics but intentionally leaves significant gaps, stimulating the player's desire to investigate further.

Why It Matters: Presenting too much information at once can be paralyzing, especially on mobile. Staging the reveals maintains momentum and makes each discovery feel earned. It transforms the player from a passive reader into an active investigator seeking missing pieces.

Specific Implementation:

Initial Evidence: On the Evidence Board, make only 1-3 core pieces of evidence available initially. These should be foundational but incomplete (e.g., the basic coroner's report, the location of the crime, perhaps one obvious piece of physical evidence).

Initial Suspects: Provide profiles for only 2-3 primary suspects at the start. These might be the most obvious individuals (the spouse, the business partner) but shouldn't include every potential person involved.

Locked Content: Clearly display icons or placeholders for crucial evidence (e.g., "Encrypted Phone Data - Requires Further Investigation," "Witness Testimony - Requires Suspect Interview") or additional suspects. Use visual cues like greyed-out icons, question marks, or lock symbols. The existence of this locked content is a driver for investigation.

Pitfalls to Avoid: Revealing the "smoking gun" evidence immediately, presenting all suspects upfront (reducing the mystery), failing to clearly indicate what information is missing or needs to be unlocked.

Intended Player Feeling: Oriented but intrigued, aware of the basic situation but cognizant of missing information, motivated to start digging into the available leads to unlock more.

Guideline 3: Enable Active Investigation & Discovery (Lens #15: Fun-Per-Second, Lens #30: Reward)

Core Principle: The process of gathering information must be interactive and rewarding, not passive reading. Every player action within the investigation phase should yield tangible, meaningful feedback or progress.

Why It Matters: Interactivity maintains engagement and reinforces the player's role as the detective. Frequent micro-rewards (discovering a clue) keep the dopamine flowing and make the 10-minute session feel productive and satisfying. It combats the feeling of simply clicking through static text screens.

Specific Implementation - Evidence:

Interactive Hotspots: Design evidence close-up screens with clearly marked interactive areas (e.g., glowing circles, highlighted text sections, magnifying glass icons).

Concise Clue Reveals: Each hotspot tap must reveal a short, impactful piece of information directly related to that specific area of the evidence. Frame these as "Clues" or "Findings."

Immediate Feedback: Accompany clue reveals with satisfying visual feedback (e.g., the hotspot dims, a checkmark appears, the clue text animates briefly) and a subtle, positive sound effect.

Specific Implementation - Suspects:

Statement Analysis: Allow players to tap on specific parts of a suspect's statement. If this statement contradicts known evidence, trigger a clear visual indication (e.g., the statement turns red, a "Contradiction!" notification appears). This transforms statements from passive text into active puzzle pieces.

Deduction Trigger: Integrate the button/mechanism to initiate the core deduction puzzle (e.g., "Two Truths and a Lie") directly within the suspect's profile, making it a natural next step after reviewing their information.

Pitfalls to Avoid: Presenting evidence as static images with long text descriptions, making hotspots difficult to find or tap, providing vague or unhelpful information upon interaction, lack of feedback for player actions.

Intended Player Feeling: Engaged, actively participating, feeling rewarded for exploration, like they are uncovering secrets piece by piece through their own actions.

Guideline 4: Prioritize Clarity & Conciseness (Lens #68: Information)

Core Principle: All information presented must be exceptionally clear, easily digestible, and unambiguous, especially given the mobile platform and short playtime. Eliminate jargon and unnecessary complexity.

Why It Matters: Confusion is the enemy of fun and flow. Players on mobile scan text quickly; long paragraphs or unclear language will cause them to lose interest or misunderstand critical details, leading to frustration. Clarity ensures the player can focus on deduction, not decryption of the UI or text.

Specific Implementation:

Text Formatting: Use bullet points extensively. Keep sentences short and direct. Employ clear headings and subheadings within evidence descriptions and suspect profiles. Use bold text sparingly to highlight only the most critical keywords or names.

Explicit Relevance: Never assume the player understands the significance of a clue. After presenting a piece of information (e.g., "Fingerprints match Suspect X"), immediately follow with a concise "Relevance:" statement (e.g., "Relevance: Places Suspect X at the scene, contradicting their alibi").

Visual Language: Use icons and visual cues consistently across all cases. Ensure icons are universally understandable (e.g., a fingerprint for forensic evidence, a speech bubble for testimony).

UI Navigation: Ensure the flow between the main Evidence Board, individual Evidence Close-Ups, and Suspect Profiles is completely intuitive. Use standard mobile navigation patterns (e.g., clear "Back" buttons). Label buttons unambiguously (e.g., "View Suspects," "Examine Evidence").

Pitfalls to Avoid: Long, dense paragraphs of text; technical jargon without explanation; ambiguous clue descriptions; inconsistent UI elements or navigation; assuming player knowledge; burying key info in non-essential text.

Intended Player Feeling: Informed, confident in their understanding of the facts, never confused about what a piece of information means or how to navigate the interface.

III. Core Deduction & Progression: Connecting the Dots

Guideline 5: Implement a Core Deduction Mechanic (Lens #28: Problem Solving)

Core Principle: Include a specific, recurring interactive mechanic that explicitly requires the player to synthesize information and apply deductive reasoning, rather than just passively absorbing facts.

Why It Matters: This is where the player feels like a detective. It transforms the experience from information gathering into active problem-solving. A consistent mechanic across cases reduces cognitive load, allowing players to focus on the content of the puzzle rather than relearning how to interact each time.

Specific Implementation:

Active Comparison: The mechanic must force the player to compare elements – evidence vs. statement, statement vs. motive, alibi vs. timeline. Examples:

"Two Truths and a Lie": Present three statements about a suspect; the player identifies the falsehood based on gathered evidence.

Statement Verification: Present a suspect's claim and ask the player to select the piece of evidence that confirms or refutes it.

Evidence Matching: Ask the player to link a specific piece of evidence to the suspect it implicates most strongly.

Case-Specific Content: While the format of the mechanic remains consistent (e.g., it's always "Two Truths and a Lie"), the actual statements, evidence options, and correct answers must be unique and directly relevant to the specifics of the current case.

Clear Instructions: Briefly explain the mechanic the first time the player encounters it in a session or case.

Pitfalls to Avoid: Deduction puzzles that are trivially easy or impossibly hard based on the available info; puzzles that don't actually require deduction (just guessing); inconsistent puzzle formats between cases; poor explanation of the puzzle rules.

Intended Player Feeling: Challenged (appropriately), clever upon solving, actively engaged in critical thinking, like they are genuinely contributing to cracking the case.

Guideline 6: Gate Key Information Behind Deduction (Lens #30: Reward)

Core Principle: Successfully solving the core deduction mechanic must directly result in unlocking significant new information or leads, reinforcing the value of the player's deductive effort.

Why It Matters: This creates a powerful reward loop. Players learn that engaging with the deduction puzzle is the primary way to progress and uncover the most crucial secrets. It makes the puzzle feel essential, not optional fluff. The unlocked information serves as both a reward and a motivator to tackle the next puzzle.

Specific Implementation:

Valuable Unlocks: The information unlocked must feel significant. This could be:

Access to a previously locked, critical piece of evidence (e.g., the decrypted messages, the hidden security footage).

The profile of a previously unrevealed suspect who changes the dynamic of the case.

A crucial clue that definitively breaks another suspect's alibi or reveals a hidden motive.

Confirmation that rules out the current suspect, allowing the player to focus elsewhere.

Clear Link: Make the connection explicit. After solving the puzzle, display a clear message like: "Correct! You've uncovered Natalie's Witness Testimony!" or "Deduction successful! Accessing encrypted phone records..."

Pitfalls to Avoid: Unlocking trivial or redundant information after solving a puzzle; making puzzle completion feel unrewarding; failing to clearly communicate what was unlocked.

Intended Player Feeling: Rewarded, accomplished, excited by the new lead, understanding that their deduction directly advanced the investigation.

Guideline 7: Clearly Signal Progress & Elimination (Lens #1: Experience)

Core Principle: Provide constant, unambiguous visual feedback about the state of the investigation, including which leads have been exhausted and which suspects have been effectively ruled out.

Why It Matters: This prevents the player from feeling lost or unsure of what to do next. It provides a tangible sense of progress and helps them manage the cognitive load of tracking multiple suspects and evidence threads. Seeing suspects get ruled out feels like successfully closing loops.

Specific Implementation:

Evidence Status: Use visual cues on the Evidence Board icons to show examined evidence (e.g., a checkmark, a dimmed icon). On the close-up screen, clearly mark which hotspots have been activated.

Suspect Elimination: When sufficient evidence definitively exonerates a suspect (e.g., a verified, unbreakable alibi), update their profile visually. This could involve:

Greying out their portrait.

Adding a prominent "Ruled Out" or "Alibi Confirmed" banner.

Optionally, providing a very brief ADA note summarizing why they are no longer a suspect.

Visual Consistency: Use the same system for signaling progress and elimination across all cases.

Pitfalls to Avoid: Leaving the player unsure if they've fully examined a piece of evidence; forcing the player to mentally track who is still a viable suspect without visual aids; inconsistent progress indicators.

Intended Player Feeling: Organized, aware of their progress, confident about which leads are still active, feeling a sense of accomplishment as the field of suspects narrows.

IV. Climax & Resolution: The Final Accusation

Guideline 8: Build to a Clear Culminating Choice (Lens #19: Story)

Core Principle: The investigation's structure and information reveals should logically funnel the player towards a final, climactic decision: accusing the most likely culprit based on the accumulated evidence.

Why It Matters: The accusation is the payoff for the player's investigative effort. The preceding steps should build narrative and logical momentum towards this moment. It should feel like the natural conclusion of their deductive process, not a random guess.

Specific Implementation:

Logical Convergence: Ensure the evidence revealed, the contradictions exposed, and the suspects eliminated logically point towards one primary culprit having the strongest combination of Means, Motive, and Opportunity, supported by the evidence. Red herrings should be debunkable with the available information.

Timing: Introduce the most damning evidence or the final key contradiction shortly before guiding the player towards the accusation phase.

Accusation Screen Design: Present the remaining viable suspects clearly (usually 2-3 at most by this stage). Use their portraits and names. Make the "Accuse" button for each suspect prominent and distinct.

Confirmation Prompt: Always include a confirmation step ("Are you sure you want to accuse [Suspect Name]? This cannot be undone.") before finalizing the accusation. This adds weight to the decision and prevents accidental taps.

Pitfalls to Avoid: The evidence being ambiguous and pointing equally to multiple suspects; introducing crucial new suspects or evidence after the player feels ready to accuse; making the correct culprit obvious from the very beginning (robbing the deduction phase of meaning); a cluttered or confusing accusation screen.

Intended Player Feeling: Confident (or reasonably certain) in their choice, feeling the weight of the decision, ready for the final reveal.

Guideline 9: Provide Clear and Concise Resolution (Lens #30: Reward)

Core Principle: Immediately following the accusation, provide unambiguous feedback on whether the player was correct or incorrect, followed by a brief, satisfying narrative and visual conclusion.

Why It Matters: This closes the loop and provides the ultimate reward (validation for a correct accusation) or feedback for improvement (guidance for an incorrect one). A clear resolution leaves the player feeling satisfied and ready for the next case (or motivated to retry).

Specific Implementation:

Instant Feedback: Display "Correct Accusation!" or "Incorrect Accusation!" text prominently and immediately.

Brief Outcome Sequence:

Correct: Show a short (3-5 second) animation or sequence depicting the culprit's arrest or confession. Include a brief congratulatory message from the ADA.

Incorrect: Show a brief animation or image representing failure (e.g., the accused walking free, ADA looking disappointed). Include a concise message encouraging review or retry ("The real killer remains at large. Review the evidence...").

Minimal Text: Keep the resolution text very short and to the point.

Clear Next Step: Prominently display the button for the next logical action: "Next Case," "Retry Case," or "Return to Menu."

Pitfalls to Avoid: Ambiguous feedback about correctness; lengthy, unskippable cutscenes for the outcome; failing to provide a clear call to action for what to do next; overly punitive feedback for incorrect guesses.

Intended Player Feeling: (Correct) Validated, successful, satisfied, ready for more. (Incorrect) Informed, understanding the mistake (implicitly or explicitly), potentially motivated to try again.

V. Overarching Principles: The Foundation of Fun

Guideline 10: Maximize Fun-Per-Second:

Core Principle: Relentlessly evaluate every screen, interaction, and piece of text. If it doesn't directly contribute to the core loop (investigation, deduction, narrative) or enhance player engagement within the 10-minute target, cut it or streamline it.

Implementation: Avoid lengthy tutorials (integrate learning into the first case), minimize loading times, ensure snappy UI responsiveness, cut redundant information, keep text hyper-concise. Every second should feel purposeful.

Guideline 11: Maintain Curiosity Throughout:

Core Principle: Beyond the initial hook, continuously seed small mysteries, unanswered questions, and intriguing contradictions throughout the case file to keep the player invested from start to finish.

Implementation: Ensure investigating one lead naturally raises questions about another. Use cliffhanger-like reveals when unlocking new evidence. Hint at deeper motives or hidden relationships that the player feels compelled to uncover.

Guideline 12: Empower Through Deduction:

Core Principle: Structure the information flow and puzzles so the player feels ownership over the solution. They should feel like their observations and logical connections cracked the case, even if the design gently guides them.

Implementation: Avoid explicitly telling the player the answer. Instead, provide the pieces (evidence, statements) and the tools (deduction mechanic) for them to assemble the solution themselves. Ensure the logical path to the correct culprit is traceable through the available information.

Guideline 13: Mobile-First Design:

Core Principle: Every design decision must prioritize the constraints and usage patterns of mobile devices.

Implementation: Use large, easily tappable buttons and hotspots. Ensure high contrast for text readability in various lighting conditions. Design layouts that work well in vertical orientation. Keep interactions simple and intuitive for touchscreens. Assume players may be playing in short bursts.

Guideline 14: Consistency is Key:

Core Principle: Maintain unwavering consistency in UI layout, icon language, interaction patterns, terminology, and the core deduction mechanic across all cases.

Implementation: Create and adhere to a strict style guide. Re-use UI components and interaction models wherever possible. This dramatically reduces the learning curve for new cases and allows players to focus on the content rather than the interface.

Guideline 15: Iterate & Playtest:

Core Principle: Treat these guidelines as a starting point. The true test is how real players experience the staged case. Rigorous playtesting is non-negotiable.

Implementation: Test each staged case with fresh eyes. Observe where players get stuck, confused, or bored. Specifically test the effectiveness of the hook. Measure completion times. Gather feedback on difficulty and enjoyment. Be prepared to tweak information reveals, puzzle difficulty, text clarity, and pacing based on this data.

By diligently applying these expanded guidelines, the design team can create a robust pipeline for producing consistently high-quality, engaging, and fun 10-minute detective cases that hook players instantly and keep them coming back for more.
